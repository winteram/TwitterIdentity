  <p class="BoldTopRule">2010 Platform: Democracy </p>


<p class="Body"><a name="309389"></a>Our nation was born as the first
great experiment in modern democracy. We seek to rescue that heritage
from the erosion of citizen participation. Moreover, we seek to
dissolve the grip of the ideology, intoned by big-money interests for
more than twenty years, that government is intrinsically undesirable
and destructive of liberty and that elected officials should rightly
"starve the beast" by slashing all spending on social program, in the
name of freedom. We challenge that tactic by calling on all Americans
to think deeply about the meaning of <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline;">government
of
the
people,
by
the
people,
and
for
the
people</span>. In a
democracy, individuals come together to form structures of governance
that protect and advance the common good. We the citizens are
the government, and we the citizens can direct it to fulfill its finest
goals and purposes. Our citizens must not permit usurpation of their
authority by acts of individuals and government agencies that isolate
or insulate government from their oversight and control. We, the
People, have a responsibility to participate in self-government
through all the means that our Constitution provides.</p>
  <p class="Body"><a name="309471"></a>Citizens of a democracy must
have the information and ability to determine the actions of their
government. Vast concentrations of wealth and power that have occurred
in recent years are inherently undemocratic. The deregulation of
corporate activity and the decentralization and underfunding of the
regulatory structures that remain - accompanied by the centralizing of
big money - has been a disaster for our country. The true owners of the
public lands, pension funds, and the public airwaves are the American
people, who today have little or no control over their pooled assets or
their commonwealth.</p>
  <p class="Body"><a name="309478"></a>The power of civic action is an
antidote to the corporate control of so much of our law-making and
regulating. The pervasive abuse imposed by corporate power increasingly
undermines our democracy, but the Green Party seeks to rekindle the
democratic flame. As voting citizens, taxpayers, workers, consumers,
and stakeholders, we unite to exercise our rights and, as Thomas
Jefferson urged, to counteract the "excesses of the monied interests."
Toward this end, we consider serious reform of campaign funding to be
essential, as well as curbs on the influence of corporations on
lawmakers and regulatory agencies.</p>
  <p class="Body"><a name="309498"></a>The Green Party considers
American democracy to be an ongoing, unfolding project that is dynamic
and creative in nature. We are committed to the strengthening of our
civil society, including the many mediating institutions at the
community level that have always characterized our democracy. We seek
to heal the alienation and apathy that has been cultivated in the
citizenry by the power-brokers of the status quo. Righteous anger about
the crippling of our democracy is rising in the land, and the Greens
offer constructive alternatives. In addition, we seek to repair the
plummeting opinion of the United States in the international community
resulting from our arrogant, narcissistic foreign policy of recent
years. A growing and grave imbalance between the citizens of this
country and the interests which extract power from the citizens is an
imminent danger to our security and national and global social
stability. We strongly feel that our country should view itself as a
member of the community of nations... not above it. The United States
could well play a leadership role in that community but only if we
become committed to an eco-social vision of peace, national
self-determination, and international cooperation.</p>
  <p><a name="309479"></a>Our goal is to become an
important political force in this country, and to present candidates
for election at every level of government.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <h2><a
 name="316100"></a>A.
    Political
    Reform&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
  1. Political debate,
public policy, and legislation should be judged on their merits, not on
the quid pro quo of political barter and money. <br>
  <br>
2. We propose
comprehensive campaign finance reform, including caps on spending and
contributions, at the national and state level; and / or full public
financing of elections to remove undue influence in political
campaigns. <br>
  <br>
3. All viable
candidates at the state and federal levels should have free and equal
radio and television time and print press coverage. <br>
  <br>
4. We will work to ban
or greatly limit political action committees and restrict soft money
contributions. <br>
  <br>
5. We support
significant lobbying regulation such as strict rules that disclose the
extent of political lobbying via "gifts" and contributions. Broad-based
reforms of government operations, with congressional reorganization and
ethics laws, must be instituted. At every level of government, we
support Sunshine Laws that open up the political system to access by
ordinary citizens.<br>
  <br>
6. We support
increasing the role of independent expository agencies, such as the
General Accounting Office.<br>
  <br>
7. We recognize
individual empowerment, full citizen participation, and proportional
representation as the foundation of an effective and pluralistic
democracy. <br>
  <br>
8. We demand choices
in our political system. This can be accomplished by proportional
representation voting systems such as: <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li class="listA">Choice Voting (candidate-based) </li>
    <li class="listA">Mixed Member Voting (combines with district representation), and </li>
    <li class="listA">Party List (party based); <br>
      and semi-proportional voting systems such as<br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">Limited Voting, and </li>
    <li class="listA">Cumulative Voting</li>
  </ul>
  All are used
throughout the free world and by U.S. businesses, and community and
non-profit groups to increase democratic representation. We call on
local governments to lead the way toward more electoral choice and
broader representation.<br>
  <br>
9. We believe in
majority rule and reject the present method of election without a
majority. Accordingly, we call for the use of Instant Runoff Voting in
chief executive races, (mayor, governor, president, etc.) where voters
can rank their favorite candidates (1,2,3, etc.) to guarantee that the
winner has majority support and that voters are not relegated to
choosing between the lesser of two evils.<br>
  <br>
10. We believe in
multi-party democracy for partisan elections as the best way to
guarantee majority rule, since more people will have representation at
the table where policy is enacted. We assert that introduction of a
multi-party democracy is essential because:<br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li class="listA">The change in the structure of electoral politics will moderate the influence of extremist views and domination by the larger parties, and offer more fair representation to a greater number of citizens; and</li>
    <li class="listA">A third party can validate and raise other points of view that need to be heard.</li>
  </ul>
  11. The Electoral
College is an 18th century anachronism. We call for a constitutional
amendment abolishing the Electoral College and providing for the direct
election of the president by Instant Runoff Voting. Until that time, we
call for a proportional allocation of delegates in state primaries.<br>
  <br>
12. Using our voice to
help others find their voice, a national Green Party should spring from
many sources: state and local Green Party electoral efforts, individual
efforts, political involvement and direction at every level. We look
toward forming bioregional confederations to coordinate regional issues
based on natural and ecosystem boundaries instead of traditional
political ones. <br>
  <br>
  <h2><a
 name="316380"></a>B.
    Political
    Participation</h2>
  <p>Greens advocate direct democracy as a response to local needs and
issues where all concerned citizens can discuss and decide questions
that immediately affect their lives, such as land use, parks, schools
and community services.&nbsp; We would decentralize many state
functions to the county and city level and seek expanded oversight and
decision-making power of local governing bodies, such as neighborhood
boards and associations, over issues that pertain to their
jurisdiction.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="listB">To ensure
      transparency in government, lesser bodies such as neighborhood boards
      and county governments must have subpoena power over state governments,
      which, in turn, should have subpoena power over the national Congress.<br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">Every jurisdiction
      should have a civilian complaint review board with subpoena power and
      the ability to order the dismissal of police officers who make false
      arrests and abuse those whom they arrest. 
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We call for more
      flexibility by states for local decision-making. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We advocate citizen
      rights to initiative, referendum and recall in all states. We believe
      that these tools of democracy should not be for sale to the wealthy who
      pay for signatures to buy their way onto the ballot. Therefore we call
      for a certain percentage of signatures gathered to come from volunteer
      collectors. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We call for citizen
      control of redistricting processes and moving the "backroom"
      apportionment process into the public light. Give the 10-year
      redistricting process to the Census Bureau or an independent agency.
      Minority representation must be protected and secured in order to
      protect minority rights. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We will act to
      broaden voter participation and ballot access. We advocate universal
      voter registration and an election day holiday and/or conducting
      elections over more than one day (say on a weekend). <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We believe that a
      binding None of the Above option on the ballot should be considered. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We support
      statehood for the District of Columbia. The residents of D.C. must have
      the same rights and representation as all other U.S. citizens. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We advocate that
      all persons convicted of felonies shall regain full citizenship rights
      upon completion of their sentence, including the right to vote and to
      run for elected office. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We advocate that
      prisoners be granted the right to vote. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">Individual
      participation in the life of our local community - in community
      projects and through personal, meaningful, voluntary activity - is also
      political and vital to the health of community. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We support citizen
      involvement at all levels of the decision-making process and hold that
      non-violent direct action can be an effective tool. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We advocate
      maintaining and enhancing federal guarantees in the areas of civil
      rights protections, environmental safeguards, and social "safety net"
      entitlements. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We demand
      re-enforcement of our civil liberties of speech, assembly, association
      and petition. Citizens may not be denied the right to public,
      non-violent protest. Citizens who engage in protest may not be
      intimidated by government surveillance, repression or retaliation. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">We call for the
      implementation of Children's Parliaments, whereby representatives are
      elected by students to discuss, debate and make proposals to their city
      councils, school boards, county legislative bodies on a local level, to
      state legislatures statewide, and to Congress nationally. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">As legislatures
      are updating voting equipment in response to the federal Helping
      America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2001, we support the growing movement of
      citizens calling for a strict requirement of a voter-verified paper
      audit trail for all voting machines installed across the United States.
      Electronic voting machines must include a verifiable paper trail that
      allows every voter to verify that his or her vote was recorded and
      counted accurately, coupled with random audits based on the paper
      trail. Technology must be used that incorporates a voter-verified paper
      trail that is accessible to vision-impaired voters. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listB">Vote-counting
      software codes manufactured by private corporations have been deemed
      proprietary, banning public review of the means by which elections are
      determined. Therefore, to protect against fraud, voting machine source
      code must be open for public inspection and verification before and
      after an election. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a
 name="313870"></a>C.
    Community  </h2>
  <p>Community is the basic unit of green politics because it is
personal, value-oriented, and small enough for each member to have an
impact.&nbsp; Community is a foundation for public policy.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="Body"><a name="309651"></a> Social diversity is the
well-spring of community life where old and young, rich and poor, and
people of all races and beliefs can interact individually and learn to
care for each other, and to understand and cooperate. We emphasize a
return to local, face-to-face relationships that humans can understand
and care about.</p>
  <p class="Body"> Among Greens, our guiding
principle is to think globally and act
locally. Community needs recognize a diversity
of issues, and local control recognizes a variety of approaches to
solving problems, ones that tend to be bottom-up not top-down. Green
politics does not place its faith in paternalistic big government.
Instead, Greens believe face-to-face interactions are essential to
productive and meaningful lives for all citizens.</p>
  <p class="Body"><a name="309653"></a> The Green vision includes
building communities that nurture families, generate good jobs and
housing, and provide public services; creating cities and towns that
educate children, encourage recreation, and preserve natural and
cultural resources; building local governments that protect people from
environmental hazards and crime; and motivating citizens to participate
in making decisions.</p>
  <p class="Body"><a name="309654"></a> The Green vision calls for a
global community of communities that recognize our immense diversity,
respect our personal worth, and share a global perspective. We call for
an approach to politics that acknowledges our endangered planet and
habitat. Our politics responds to global crises with a new way of
seeing our shared international security.</p>
  <p class="Body"><a name="309655"></a> We will conceive a new era of
international cooperation and communication that nurtures cultural
diversity, recognizes the interconnectedness between communities, and
promotes opportunities for cultural exchange and assistance. <br>
  </p>
  <p class="Body">We call for increased
public transportation, convenient playgrounds and parks for all
sections of cities and small towns, and funding to encourage diverse
neighborhoods.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
  <p class="Body">We support a rich
milieu of art, culture, and significant (yet modestly funded) programs
such as the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for
the Humanities. <br>
  <br>
  </p>
<h4><a name="3106771"></a>1. Families and Children </h4>
<ul>
  <li class="listA"> We call for social policies to focus on protecting families. The young - our citizens of tomorrow - are increasingly at risk. Programs must ensure that children, who are among the most vulnerable members of society, receive basic nutritional, educational, and medical necessities. The Green Party supports and seeks to expand Head Start and Pre- and neo-natal programs. A Children's Agenda should be put in place to focus attention and concerted action on the future that is our children. </li>
  <li class="listA">A universal, federally funded childcare program for pre-school and young schoolchildren should be developed. </li>
  <li class="listA">Family assistance such as the earned income tax credit, available to working poor families in which the parent supports and lives with the children, should be maintained and increased to offset regressive payroll taxes and growing inequalities in American society. </li>
  <li class="listA">A living family wage is vital to the social health of communities. </li>
  <li class="listA">The actuarial protection of social security is essential to the well-being of our seniors, and maintenance of the system's integrity is an essential part of a healthy community. We oppose privatization of social security, call for the program to remain under the aegis of the Federal Government, and seek to expand its effectiveness.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="listA">We support the leading-edge work of non-profit public interest groups and those individuals breaking out of "careerism" to pursue non-traditional careers in public service. </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="3106772"></a>2. Alternative Community Service </h4>
  <ul>
    <li class="listA">We must create new
      opportunities for citizens to serve their communities through
      non-military community service. Alternative community service to the
      military should be encouraged. </li>
    <li class="listA">We advocate the
      formation of a Civilian Conservation Corps, with national leadership
      and state and local affiliates, to spearhead efforts to work on the
      tasks of environmental education, restoration of damaged habitats,
      reforestation, and cleaning up polluted waterways. Providing land and
      resource management skills will challenge young people while
      encouraging social responsibility.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a
 name="309652"></a>D.
    Free Speech and Media
    Reform</h2>
  <p>Independent, critical media are essential to an informed and healthy
    democracy.&nbsp; Citizens must have ready access to news and
    information to make responsible informed choices as voters and to carry
    out their other duties of citizenship.<br>
    <br>
    The United States&#8217; original communications policy was the 1st
    Amendment. Freedom of the press was guaranteed in the Constitution
    because an exchange of ideas and an unfettered debate were considered
    essential components of a democratic society. Today, however,
    government policy is designed less to enhance public deliberation than
    to boost the profitability of media corporations. <br>
    <br>
    Our media laws and rules promote the formation of huge media
    conglomerates while discouraging competing voices. As a result, the
    mainstream media is increasingly cozy with the economic and political
    elites whom they should be investigating. Mergers in the news industry
    have accelerated, further limiting the spectrum of viewpoints in the
    mass media. With U.S. media overwhelmingly owned by for-profit
    conglomerates and supported by corporate advertisers, investigative
    journalism is in an alarming decline.<br>
    <br>
    In response, Greens will strengthen citizens&#8217; influence over the
    broadcast media, break up the dominant media conglomerates and boost
    the number of community and non-profit news outlets, all to fortify the
    media&#8217;s crucial watchdog function and to help create a more diverse and
    lively exchange of ideas in America.<br>
    <br>
    Since governments too often have an interest in controlling the flow of
    information, we must constantly guard against official censorship. In
    our society however, large corporations are a far more common source of
    censorship than governments. Media outlets kill stories because they
    undermine corporate interests; advertisers use their financial clout to
    squelch negative reports; powerful businesses employ the threat of
    expensive lawsuits to discourage legitimate investigations. The most
    frequent form of censorship is self-censorship: journalists deciding
    not to pursue certain stories that they know will be unpopular with the
    advertisers.</p>
  
  <p class="BlackBold">Green Solutions</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="listB">Promote greater public control and oversight of the public airwaves.</li>
    <li class="listB">Enact tough new anti-trust laws for the media, carve up the big media conglomerates, and follow up with vigorous anti-trust enforcement.</li>

    <li class="listB">Establish substantial public interest obligations for broadcasters and hold them accountable, and revoke licenses from outlets that fail to satisfy these obligations.</li>
    <li class="listB"> Support Public, Educational and Governmental (PEG) Access Television to ensure that citizens and community organizations have the opportunity to create and present their own programming on cable television.</li>
    <li class="listB">Expand the role of community radio, by expanding the licensing of new non-commercial low power FM radio stations.</li>
    <li class="listB">Promote greater opportunity for women and minority ownership of media outlets.</li>
    <li class="listB">Provide broadband internet access for all residents of this country, so that access to information is a right, not a commodity.</li>

    <li class="listB">Ensure free and equal airtime for all ballot-qualified political candidates and parties on radio and television networks and stations.</li>
    <li class="listB">Provide generous public funding for Public Broadcasting System (PBS) television and National Public Radio (NPR) to ensure high-quality news and cultural programming with the widest possible range of viewpoints.</li>
    <li class="listB">Prohibit commercial advertising targeted to children under 12 years old, as well as advertising in public places such as schools, parks, and government buildings.</li>
    <li class="listB">Oppose censorship in the arts, media, press and on the Internet.</li>
    <li class="listB">Reform the Federal Communications Commission so that it is responsive and accountable to the public at large, not just to lobbyists and commercial interests.</li>
    <li class="listB">Overhaul the 1996 Telecommunications Act, with a new focus on promoting diversity and true competition, and preventing consolidation.</li>
    <li class="listB">Reduce mailing costs for non-profit and independent magazines and journals, and eliminate them for those that receive less than 20% of their revenues from advertising.</li>
    <li class="listB">Promote policies to expand investigative reporting on federal, state and local issues.</li>
    <li class="listB">Promote policies to encourage the people of the United States to watch less television, and instead to spend time with their families, friends and neighbors, and to engage in myriad other constructive, artistic or healthful pursuits.</li>
    <li class="listB">Create a publicly-controlled &#8220;Audience Network&#8221; empowered to take airtime from commercial television and radio stations, to broadcast a variety of non-commercial cultural, political, entertainment, scientific or other high-quality programs. </li>

  <h2 class="Body"><a name="313976"></a>E. Foreign Policy</h2>
  <p class="Body">At the start of a new century, we stand poised
between the geopolitical conflict of East versus West; a future marked
by the aftermath of the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001; the
dangers of global terrorism; the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan
followed by the unprovoked invasion and occupation of Iraq; the
escalation of conflict in the Middle East; and the continued research
and development of nuclear weapons and the stockpiling of bio-chemical
weapons.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="Body">&nbsp;In the area of trade, third- and fourth-world
economies and resources are being ravaged, and our own economy and job
security undermined, by global corporatization which concentrates
greater power in the hands of fewer interests who are unaccountable to
the vast majority of the world's people.</p>
  <p class="Body">As we overcome continued
conflicts and violence we realize the difficulties inherent in
encouraging democracy and of advancing the cause of peace. We face a
more complex set of challenges in how our nation defines its national
security. Greens support sustainable development and social and
economic justice across the globe. Reducing militarism and reliance on
arms policies is the key to progress toward collective security.<br>

  <h4><a name="310677"></a>2. A Real Road to Peace in the Middle East</h4>
  <p>The Green Party of
the United States recognizes that our
greatest contribution to peace in the Middle East will come through our
impact on U.S. policy in the region.</p>
  <p>Our
    commitments to ecological
    wisdom, social justice, grass-roots democracy,
    and non-violence compel us to oppose </span>U.S.</span> government support for
  &#8220;friendly&#8221; regimes in the region when those regimes violate human
    rights,
    international law, and existing treaties. We call on congressional
    intelligence
    committees to conduct comprehensive public hearings on the development
    and
    deployment of weapons of mass destruction by all states in the region. U.S. policy should support the
    removal and/or destruction of all such weapons wherever they are found
    there.</p>
<h4>The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict</h4>
<p>Our Green values oblige us to support popular movements for peace and demilitarization in Israel-Palestine, especially those that reach across the lines of conflict to engage both Palestinians and Israelis of good will.</p>

<ul>
<li class="listA">We reaffirm the right of self-determination for both Palestinians and Israelis, which precludes the self-determination of one at the expense of the other. We recognize the historical and contemporary cultural diversity of Israeli-Palestinian society, including the religious heritage of Jews, Christians, Muslims and others. This is a significant part of the rich cultural legacy of all these peoples and it must be respected. To ensure this, we support equality before international law rather than appeals to religious faith as the fair basis on which claims to the land of Palestine-Israel are resolved.</li>
<li class="listA">We recognize that Jewish insecurity and fear of non-Jews is understandable in light of Jewish history of horrific oppression in Europe. However, we oppose as both discriminatory and ultimately self-defeating the position that Jews would be fundamentally threatened by the implementation of full rights to Palestinian-Israelis and Palestinian refugees who wish to return to their homes. As U.S. Greens, we refuse to impose our views on the people of the region. Still, we would turn the U.S. government towards a new policy, which itself recognizes the equality, humanity, and civil rights of Jews, Muslims, Christians, and all others who live in the region, and which seeks to build confidence in prospects for secular democracy.</li>
<li class="listA">We reaffirm the right and feasibility of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes in Israel. We acknowledge the significant challenges of equity and restitution this policy would encounter and call on the U.S. government to make resolution of these challenges a central goal of our diplomacy in the region.d. We reject U.S. unbalanced financial and military support of Israel while Israel occupies Palestinian lands and maintains an apartheid-like system in both the Occupied Palestinian Territories and in Israel toward its non-Jewish citizens. Therefore, we call on the U.S. President and Congress to suspend all military and foreign aid, including loans and grants, to Israel until Israel withdraws from the Occupied Territories, dismantles the separation wall in the Occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem, ends its siege of Gaza and its apartheid-like system both within the Occupied Palestinian Territories and in Israel toward its non-Jewish citizens.</li>
<li class="listA">We also reject U.S. political support for Israel and demand that the U.S. government end its veto of Security Council resolutions pertaining to Israel. We urge our government to join with the U.N. to secure Israel&#8217;s complete withdrawal to the 1967 boundaries and its compliance with international law.</li>
<li class="listA">We support a much stronger and supportive U.S. position with respect to all United Nations, European Union, and Arab League initiatives that seek a negotiated peace. We call for an immediate U.N.-sponsored, multinational peacekeeping and protection force in the Palestinian territories with the mandate to initiate a conflict-resolution commission.</li>
<li class="listA">We call on the foreign and military affairs committees of the U.S. House and Senate to conduct full hearings on the status of human rights and war crimes in Palestine-Israel, especially violations committed during Israel&#8217;s 2008-2009 invasion of Gaza (&#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221;) as documented in the 2009 &#8220;UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict&#8221; (&#8220;The Goldstone Report&#8221;) authorized by the UN Commission on Human Rights.</li>
<li class="listA">We
recognize that despite decades of continuous diplomatic attempts
by the
international community, it has failed to bring about Israel&#8217;s
compliance with
international law or respect for basic Palestinian human rights; and
that,
despite abundant condemnation of Israel&#8217;s policies by the UN,
International
Court of Justice, and all relevant international conventions, the
international
community of nations has failed to stop Israeli violations of
Palestinian human
rights in Israel and the OPT, while Israeli crimes continue with
impunity. We recall that ending institutionalized racism (apartheid) in
South
Africa demanded an unusual, cooperative action by the entire
international
community in the form of a boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS)
campaign against
apartheid South Africa, and that BDS can become the most
effective nonviolent means for achieving justice and genuine peace
between
Palestinians and Israelis, and for the region, through concerted
international
pressure as applied to apartheid South Africa; and that Palestinian
resistance
to ongoing dispossession has mainly been nonviolent, including its most
basic
form &#8211; remaining in their homes, on their land; and that while
Palestinian
armed resistance is legitimate under international law when directed at
non-civilian targets, we believe that only nonviolent resistance will
maintain
the humanity of Palestinian society, elicit the greatest solidarity
from
others, and maximize the chance for future reconciliation between
Israelis and
Palestinians. However, we also recognize that our appeal to
Palestinians to
continue to resist nonviolently in the face of ongoing existential
threats from Israel is hypocritical unless
accompanied by substantial acts of international support. We recall
that in
2005, Palestinian Civil Society appealed to the international community
to
support a BDS campaign against Israel;and that in response the
Green Party of the US endorsed this BDS campaign in 2005.
Therefore, we support the implementation of boycott and divestment
initiatives
against Israel similar to those applied to South Africa in the
apartheid era,
which includes pressuring our government to impose embargoes and
sanctions
against Israel; and we support maintaining these nonviolent punitive
measures
until Israel meets its obligation to recognize the Palestinian people&#8217;s
inalienable right to self-determination and fully complies with the
precepts of
international law by:
  <ul>
    <li> Ending its
occupation and colonization of all Palestinian lands and
dismantling the Wall in the West Bank;</li>
    <li>Recognizing
the fundamental rights of Palestinian citizens of to full equality; and</li>
    <li>Respecting,
protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return
to their
homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.</li>
  </ul>
  </i>
<li class="listA">We recognize that international opinion has been committed to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yet, we view the two-state solution as neither democratic nor viable in the face of international law, material conditions and &#8220;facts on the ground&#8221; that now exist in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Given this reality, we support a U.S. foreign policy that promotes the creation of one secular, democratic state for Palestinians and Israelis on the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan as the national home of both peoples, with Jerusalem as its capital. We encourage a new U.S. diplomatic initiative to begin the long process of negotiation, laying the groundwork for such a single-state constitution.</li>
<li class="listA">We recognize that such a state might take many forms and that the eventual model chosen must be decided by the peoples themselves. We also acknowledge the enormous hostilities that now exist between the two peoples, but history tells us that these are not insurmountable among people genuinely seeking peace.
  </p>
<li class="listA">As an integral part of peace negotiations and the transition to peaceful democracy, we call for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission whose inaugurating action would be mutual acknowledgement by Israelis and Palestinians that they have the same basic rights, including the right to exist in the same, secure place.</li>

  </ul>
<h4><a name="307464"></a>3. Foreign Policy - Trade </h4>
<p class="Body">We urge our government to do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="listA">Re-formulate all
      international trade relations and commerce as currently upheld by the
      North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the World Trade
      Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World
      Bank (WB), and the nascent Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) to
      protect the labor, human rights, economy, environment and domestic
      industry of partner and recipient nations so that the growth of local
      industry and agriculture has the advantage over foreign corporate
      domination. </li>
    <li class="listA">Re-structure the
      rules of performance of the IMF/WB to end the debts of recipient
      nations, and to install strict standards in the IMF/WB that control the
      use of grants or loans to prevent fraud, misuse, and subversion of
      funds by recipient governments. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">Re-write the rules
      for investment of corporate capital in projects operated under the
      IMF/WB to guarantee the rights of the citizens of the nations receiving
      the investment and their right to public ownership and control of their
      own resources. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">Mandate and protect
      labor's right to organize, create unions and negotiate with management
      in all countries receiving U.S. investment, and require U.S.
      corporations that operate in other countries to guarantee those workers
      the same rights that American workers enjoy. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">Legislate and
      enable oversight by an independent agency or a labor union to verify
      that foreign workers' rights are protected. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">At home, secure the
      rights of our states to establish stricter standards for health,
      safety, and for the environment than those of our national government,
      and to protect themselves against substandard, imported goods. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">Secure the right of
      states and municipalities to refuse to invest in foreign businesses
      that do not abide by their standards for imported goods, fair trade,
      and environmental protection. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">Prohibit U.S.
      corporations from avoiding or evading payment of their taxes by banking
      abroad or locating their charters offshore. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">Every day over $1
      trillion dollars circles the globe in currency trade - wreaking havoc
      on low-economy nations - without obligation to sustainable investment.
      We seek to restrict the unfettered flow of capital and currency trade,
      and levy the Tobin tax of .05% on cross border currency
      transactions.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">We support the
      funding and expansion of non-government organizations (NGOs) in their
      missions to educate and train people of less developed nations in
      initiating local business and economic development, and in providing
      health care and family planning. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">Under the agency of
      the United Nations, we demand that our government renew and initiate
      government funding and support for family planning, contraception, and
      abortion in all countries that request it. <br>
    </li>
    <li class="listA">We reject the U.S.
      government's economic blockade of Cuba. We ask the U.S. Congress to
      lift the embargo and restore normal diplomatic relations and respect
      for national sovereignty, and demand that the U.S. government end its
      veto of U.N. resolutions pertaining to Cuba.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4><a name="310678"></a>4. Human Rights</h4>
    <p>We propose the following amendment to
    the Constitution of the United States:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="listA">The rights established by this Constitution and the laws of the
      United States of America are exclusively the rights
      of living, breathing humans, citizens of this country or residing
      therein. No
      corporation or other type of association or organization can have the
      status of
      a &#8220;legal person,&#8221; and thus cannot derive rights from such status.</li>
    <li class="listA">These organizations have no permanent, constitutionally protected
      rights,
      though they may have such powers or immunities as are explicitly
      granted to
      them by legislative actions at either the federal or the state level.
      These
      powers or immunities may be modified or removed by later action of the
      same
      legislative bodies. In no case can these powers or immunities override
      the
      constitutionally protected rights of human beings. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h4><a name="310679"></a>5. Women's Rights</span></h4>
  
   <ul>
     <li class="listA">The Green Party makes a strong and urgent call for U.S.
       passage of CEDAW, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
       Discrimination Against Women which was adopted in 1979 by the UN
       General
       Assembly and ratified by 173 countries. It is also known as the Women&#8217;s
       Convention,
       the Women&#8217;s Bill of Rights, and an International Bill of Rights for
       Women. The United States is one of a very few countries and
       the only industrialized nation that has not ratified it.</span></li>
     <li class="listA">The illegal international
       trafficking in humans, primarily women, has
       reached staggering numbers and consequences around the world. The Green
       Party
       supports the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking In
       Persons, Especially Women and Children, which supplements the UN
       Convention
       against Transnational Organized Crime adopted by the UN General
       Assembly in
       November 2000 as an important tool to facilitate international
       cooperation. The
       U.S. and 80
       other countries signed the Protocol in December 2000 and by doing so
       have made
       a commitment to criminalize trafficking and to protect its many
       victims. We
       call for effective collaborative relationships between sending and
       receiving
       countries, including the U.S.
       We also call for studies analyzing and connecting the role of
       globalization in
       trafficking. <br>

  <h4><a name="307680"></a>6. Puerto Rican Independence</h4>
In 1898, Puerto Rico was invaded by
the United States and has been held by the
U.S. in the form of a colony ever since. In response to international
pressure,
in 1952, the U.S.
established the &#8220;Free Associated State&#8221; status for Puerto Rico but
continued to claim that Puerto Rico
belongs to, yet is not a part of, the United States.<br>
  <br>
Greens support the right of the people of Puerto Rico to
self-determination and independence in conformity with United Nations
Resolution 1514(XV)
of 1960, the release of all Puerto Rican political prisoners being held
in
U.S. prisons, and call for the appropriate environmental clean-up and
sustainable development of Vieques and Culebra, islands that were used
as firing
ranges by the U.S. military. We oppose recruitment of the youth of
Puerto Rico into the U.S.
armed forces and their deployment to U.S.
wars abroad.<br>

  <h2><a name="314109"></a>F. Domestic Security </h2>

impartial and independent investigation of the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001, including the role of the administration of George
W. Bush, vaarious U.S. based corporations and interests, and other
nations and third parties.
  </p>
  <p>We call for the repeal of the USA PATRIOT
Act. Many of its provisions, along with many of the other so-called
National
Security Acts, undermine and erode our Bill of Rights, and contribute
to the
destruction of the democratic foundation of checks and balances between
the
branches of government.</p>
  <p class="body">&nbsp;The Greens believe that all such systematic
degradation or elimination of our constitutional protections must stop,
and
that corrective measures need to be taken in a timely manner by
Congress to
fully reinstate all such losses of guaranteed citizen protections.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <h4><a name="307464"></a>1. Civil
liberties</h4>
  <p class="body">Greens want to stop the assault on our civil
liberties that intensified
after
9/11, and restore these and other freedoms to all people.<br>
  <br>
During the last several decades, there has been an erosion of freedom
in the United States. This has come from many sources and
takes many forms, including the war on drugs and widespread
imprisonment of
nonviolent drug offenders; the increased use of personal
identification,
surveillance of employees at work, and the growing use of private
security
forces by corporations; restrictions on the speech of protesters and
students;
and random traffic stops of persons of color and the commonplace use of
roadblocks.<br>
  <br>
Since 9/11, this erosion has turned into a collapse of our freedoms, as
then
President Bush authorized torture, illegal wiretapping, indefinite
detention
without trial, and widespread government surveillance.<br>
  <br>
Greens want to make sure that the United States
is not the first nation in history to lose its constitutional freedoms
because
we forgot what they were, and why we had them in the first place. We
believe
that the people of the United States
must, once again, act as if we were free, and force our government to
restore
our constitutional freedoms.<br>

  <ul>
    <li class="listA">Strict enforcement of our First
      Amendment rights of speech,
      assembly,

      warrantless wiretaps violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance

  <h2><a name="314110"></a>G. Demilitarization and Exploration of Space</h2>
  <p>The Green Party recognizes the need for the inspiration and education
    that the peaceful exploration of Space provides; the need for
    space-based systems to monitor environmental conditions on Earth; the
    many advances in space technology that benefit all people on Earth; and
    the inspiration provided to children by Space exploration&nbsp; that
    can prompt them to pursue math, science, and other important courses of
    study. <br>
    <br>
    The peaceful
    exploration of Space has been usurped by the militarization of Space.
    The last four U.S. - backed military conflicts have used space-based
    technology to
    disrupt the computer and communication systems of sovereign states. The
    funds required for continuing peaceful Space exploration have been
    used, instead, for the design, implementation and deployment of
    wasteful and dangerous Space hardware, such as the Strategic Defense

      International Treaty for the Demilitarization of Space. The Green Party
      advocates a reduction of human-staffed space flight due to the high
      cost and risk for human life and the availability of automated
      technology that can perform necessary functions in space-based
      research. </li>
