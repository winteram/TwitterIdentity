Thank you. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. As you can see, we are slightly delayed. {LAUGHTER} When I took off this morning at 6:30 a.m. from the White House it was clear and beautiful. We had our normal 15-minute helicopter ride to Andrews Air Force Base, which was shrouded in fog. We flew around for 20 minutes in the airplane. When we got on the ground it was like being in a sci-fi movie. It took us another 20 minutes to find Air Force One. {LAUGHTER} You couldn't see your hand before you. And then we sat and sat and sat. So thanks for waiting. And happy Halloween. {LAUGHTER ; APPLAUSE} 

Now, your leader here told me about your normal Halloween dress. And I feel cheated that you didn't wear your costumes this morning. {LAUGHTER} I used to do that, but since I became President they have relegated me to a small pin. {LAUGHTER} But I hope you have a good time when we get out of here.

As you can tell, my voice has given out on me, and therefore, most of my remarks are going to be delivered by our fine Secretary of Commerce, Bill Daley, who is from Chicago, my wife's hometown, where they just -- {APPLAUSE} -- somebody is from Chicago out there. They had a birthday celebration for Hillary's 50th birthday there, and I didn't think anything could make that a pleasant occurrence, but it actually did and she was happy with it. {LAUGHTER}

Secretary Daley just came back from our trip to Latin America with me and he'll have some more to say about fast track. But before I introduce him, and before I completely lose my voice, I want to say that I have worked very hard so that there would be more stories like Deborah Braziel's in this country. And in the last five years, we have vigorously pursued an economic strategy that would move us away from big deficits and move us away from living day by day, to have long-term, stable growth that hard-working Americans could participate in and benefit from.

We've had a commitment to reduce the deficit and balance the budget, to educate and train people and invest more in that and in technology, and to sell more American products and services around the world. That's been our strategy, and it's worked.

And I want to say a special word of thanks to Congressman Foley and Congressman Deutsch here, a Republican and a Democrat, for helping us to pass the historic balanced budget agreement that passed the Congress last summer. We haven't had a balanced budget since 1969, but the deficit has gone from $290 billion to $22.5 billion in the last four years, and now we're going to balance the thing. It's going to be good for us. {APPLAUSE}

We just learned today that over the past year our economy has grown at 4 percent. That's the fastest rate of growth in a decade, and one big reason is $125 billion in new exports. You helped the American economy to grow. You helped the American economy to create over 13 million jobs, and I thank you for it. {APPLAUSE}

This strategy is working, and we have to continue to pursue it all. Yes, we reduced the deficit by 90 percent, but we needed that bill last August to balance the budget because our costs will keep going up if we don't continue to cut. We also need to invest more in education, and we've done more to open the doors of college than ever before, with tax credits and scholarships and better loans and education IRAs. And a lot of your children will now be able to take advantage of that, and maybe some of you will want to take advantage of that.

But it's a three-legged stool; we have got to have the exports. This fast track debate in Washington is totally, I think, off the radar screen for most Americans. I bet if you ask most people what fast track was they'd say it's a new television series, or maybe a new offensive football strategy. It's simply the same authority that Presidents have had for the last 20-odd years, to negotiate agreements, take them back to Congress and have them vote up or down.

If I go and make an agreement with somebody who lives in a different system of government, they don't understand if -- they can understand if the Congress rejects the agreement, but they don't want to have to negotiate it again with 535 people after they negotiate it with my representatives. So most countries simply won't enter into agreements with us unless I have the authority to make an agreement and say, now, the Congress is the ultimate decider here, they've got to vote up or down; if it's bad for America, they're not going to vote for it. But at least you won't have it rewritten, we'll vote it up or down. That's all the bill does and that's why Presidents have had it for the last 20-something years.

So I hope you will stick with us. I hope you'll urge the congressmen and senators to vote for it. And I hope you'll tell them that without regard to party, this is an American issue. It's helped to create jobs here at Tropical. It will help to take us into the 21st century. And if they'll stick with you on this, you will stick with them.

Thank you very much. Now I'd like to ask Secretary Daley to come up and say what I wish I had the strength to say.

Secretary Daley.

Thank you and God bless you. {APPLAUSE}
