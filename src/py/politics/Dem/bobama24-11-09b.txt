Good evening, everyone. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. Aapka Swagat Hai. {APPLAUSE}

Many of you were here when I was honored to become the first President to help celebrate Diwali -- the Festival of Lights. {APPLAUSE} Some of you were here for the first White House celebration of the birth of the founder of Sikhism -- Guru Nanak. {APPLAUSE} Tonight, we gather again, for the first state dinner of my presidency -- with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Mrs. Gursharan Kaur, as we celebrate the great and growing partnership between the United States and India.

As we all know, in India some of life's most treasured moments are often celebrated under the cover of a beautiful tent. It's a little like tonight. We have incredible food and music and are surrounded by great friends. For it's been said that "the most beautiful things in the universe are the starry heavens above us and the feeling of duty within us."

Mr. Prime Minister, today we worked to fulfill our duty --bring our countries closer together than ever before. Tonight, under the stars, we celebrate the spirit that will sustain our partnership -- the bonds of friendship between our people.

It's a bond that includes more than two million Indian Americans who enrich every corner of our great nation -- leaders in government, science, industry and the arts -- some of whom join us tonight. And it's the bond of friendship between a President and a Prime Minister who are bound by the same unshakable spirit of possibility and brotherhood that transformed both our nations -- a spirit that gave rise to movements led by giants like Gandhi and King, and which are the reason that both of us can stand here tonight.

And so, as we draw upon these ties that bind our common future together, I want to close with the words that your first Prime Minister spoke at that midnight hour on the eve of Indian independence, because Nehru's words speak to our hopes tonight: "The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the great triumphs and achievements that await us…The past is over and it is the future that beckons us now."

So I propose a toast to all of you.

Does the Prime Minister get a glass? Thank you.

Just logistically, we want to make sure the Prime Minister has a glass here. {LAUGHTER}

To the future that beckons all of us. Let us answer its call. And let our two great nations realize all the triumphs and achievements that await us.

Cheers.
