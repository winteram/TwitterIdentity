I think he just answered the question. Every day when you get up, you have a choice about how you view whatever the facts are. Life is always imperfect, and there will always be problems. It's part of the human condition. So you have to choose, are you going to see the glass as half empty or half full? It may be that we're a little more optimistic, because we have lived a little longer. For example, he talked about the commie bastards. That was funny. I think it's highly unlikely with all the problems we've got, we're worried about North Korea and Iran. It is tragic that the peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians has not been restarted. It's a good time to do it, too, because all the Arab states now are worried more about Iran than Israel. There's lots of problems. We're worried about climate change, and we should be, because if we continue to stick our heads in the sand, sometime over the next 50 years, we'll have a pretty calamitous situation. But there is an economically viable way out of it, and one that would improve our national security. If I were running for president this year, I would almost run on nothing but energy. {APPLAUSE}

Here's what I want to say: We all feel more vulnerable because of 9/11, because it means we can be hit here. It used to be that was something that happened to somebody that we were supposed to go save. Now it could happen to us. And it could happen to us. But our country and the future of freedom and free enterprise and human aspiration looks brighter to me in the 21st Century than it did in the 20th. Don't forget, you had 9 million people killed in World War I, 12 million people killed in World War II, 20 million people killed in the Soviet Union in the purges between the war and immediately afterward, God only knows how many million people killed in the Chinese purge, 2 million people killed in Cambodia. You forget what happened in the 20th Century. How many people still live in slavery? And we know more about problems elsewhere than we used to know, because of the globalization of information technology, which means our conscience is now moved by Darfur, for example. But you should see it as a positive thing that you are interconnected with people all over the world, and that you can make some difference.

But the fact that the world has problems should not be a cause for cynicism or despondence or despair. That's what makes it fun, to go hit them. Think how much more boring life would be if there were no challenges. We would all just sit around blissed out all the time. I think this is a choice. He makes a choice. {COMMENT="Indicating Mr. Orfalea"} Don't you think it's interesting how he sees the world different from you? He said that Yellow Pages thing. I bet none of you ever thought that. So how could you not be optimistic if you've met enough people, if you've known enough things, and if you know enough about human potential? I think people ought to be asking this question of the wild-eyed cynics and the wild-eyed pessimists, not the wild-eyed optimists. I think human history is on our side. {APPLAUSE}
