The choice we make in the next 40 days could well shape our future for the next 40 years. You ought to be able to know what the candidates are proposing to do with our prosperity so you can judge for yourselves. If we do things right, we n have it within our grasp to completely eliminate the national debt by the year 2012, saving taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in interest payments. If we make the right choices, we can make Social Security financially sound for more than 50 years and make Medicare financially sound for another 30 years. If we make the right choices, we can reach the day in the next few years when seven in ten Americans live in their own homes and family incomes rise by one-third. 

So let me tell you where I stand when it comes to the economy. I believe in fiscal discipline and paying down the debt -- this year, next year and every year. I believe in smart investments in the future, not massive tax cuts for the few that could bring us back into deficit. And, above all, I believe prosperity has to work for the working and middle class families who built this economy, the families who are the hope and soul of this country. That's who I'm fighting for. I'm talking about people making house payments and car payments, parents struggling to find more time to spend with their kid and pass on the right values, families that need help affording college tuition, healthcare for their kids, or job training to earn more and lift themselves to a better life. And I will not accept a massive tax cut that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest 1%, which would hurt middle class families and make today's balanced budget tomorrow's distant memory. Under the Gore/Leberman economic plan, for very new dollar that we put into tax cuts or new investments, we'll set aside $2 to pay down the debt. And for every dollar we put into new spending, we'll also put a dollar into tax cuts for working and middle class families. 

So here's the bottom line: Our plan gives $500 billion in targeted, middle class tax cuts, it makes the right investments in education, health care, a clean environment and a secure retirement, it provides an additional $100 billion for our national defense, and it balances the budget and pays down the national debt. This isn't just about numbers; it's about the standard of life for America's families, and it's about what's good for America's businesses. If we pay down the debt and keep interest rates low, then the private sector doesn't have to compete with the federal government for investment capital. Productivity rises, jobs are created, and the economy prospers. Now is the time to pursue economic policies that are good for our families and good for business. This is not the time to invite new deficits and high interest rates that could stifle both our growth and our hopes. That is why this issue is so important. That is why 40 days from now, prosperity itself will be on the ballot. You deserve a President who will honor your hard work by making the hard choices on economic policy. If you entrust me with the presidency, as I've said before, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician, but I will work every day to keep the economy strong, and I will never let you down. Thank you. God bless you. And let's win this fight. {APPLAUSE} Thank you very much.
