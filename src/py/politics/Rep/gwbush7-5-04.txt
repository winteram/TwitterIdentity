{speech} 

Thank you all for coming. {APPLAUSE} Thank you all for coming out. Come on, Laura. As you can see, I'm traveling with the A Team of the Bush family. {APPLAUSE} We're really glad to be here in Wisconsin and I want to thank you all for coming out to say "hello." 

We're on a bus trip because I'm out asking for the vote. {APPLAUSE} I'm here to tell the people of this state I'd like to be your President for four more years. {APPLAUSE} And one of the best reasons why is to keep Laura as the First Lady for four years. {APPLAUSE} 

I'm not really here to politic you too much, but I do want you to know that I've got a plan to win this war on terror and I've got a plan to spread freedom and peace -- that's what I want to do. {APPLAUSE} We're going to have to be tough in the years coming, and we've got to be compassionate, too. This economy of ours is getting better. I hope the people in this part of the state are working. I know the farm economy is strong, and that's good for America, it's good for this part of Wisconsin. {APPLAUSE} 

I've got a plan to keep us going, so people can find work and realize their dreams. We got some good news today. They added -- we added 288,000 new jobs last month. That's a good sign. {APPLAUSE} Part of it has to do with making sure you get to keep more of your own money. That stimulus plan is working. 

And, finally, my job is to tap into the compassion of America. Let me tell you where the strength of the country is: The strength of the country is in the hearts and souls of our citizens, like the people living right here in Lancaster. That's the strength of this country. {APPLAUSE} And for those of you who are -- those of you who are loving your neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself, I'm here to thank you for that; thanking you for mentoring children; thanking you for feeding the hungry, providing shelter for the homeless; thank you for hearing that universal call -- that universal call to help change this country one heart and one soul at a time. My job is to rally the spirit of this great country, and that's what I'm -- that's what I'm doing, traveling your great state. {APPLAUSE} 

I'm proud you're here, Mr. Mayor, thanks for coming. Come on up here, Mr. Mayor. I always like to give the mayors advice. {APPLAUSE} My advice is: fill the potholes. {LAUGHTER} Thanks for coming, Mayor. 

{OTHER-SPEAK} Mr. President, sir, on behalf of all these great citizens in Lancaster and the surrounding area, I'd like to present you and your lovely wife this key to the city of Lancaster. {APPLAUSE} And we, too, would like to be a key in your plan, so we really appreciate you being here today. Thank you very much, Mr. President. {/OTHER-SPEAK} 

Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thanks for coming. {APPLAUSE} 

Again, thank you all for coming out to say "hello." We're kind of heading down the road, but before I leave I do want to say, I ask for God's blessings on you, and may God continue to bless our country. Thank you. God bless. {APPLAUSE}
