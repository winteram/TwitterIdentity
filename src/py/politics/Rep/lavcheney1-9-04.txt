Well, thank you for that warm welcome.

In the weeks and months after September 11th, I had so many people come up to me and say how glad they were that George Bush and Dick Cheney were in the White House. {APPLAUSE} I knew exactly what they meant. These men are strong, they are steadfast, they are exactly the leaders we need at this moment in our history. {APPLAUSE}

And let me say a word, too, about Laura Bush. She not only reassured us in those days after the towers fell, she has been a First Lady of enormous grace and dignity, and I am honored to be her friend.

I first met Dick Cheney when he was a teenager, quite a handsome teenager, as a matter of fact. He had a crew cut. He played football. He was the president of our senior class. But while most of the boys I knew saw the charm of driving back and forth, time and again, between the two A&W root beer stands in our small town, Dick did not. And when practically everybody in Casper, Wyoming started doing the twist, I can tell you, Dick did not. {LAUGHTER} He also spent as much time listening as he did talking, which is pretty unusual in a teenager.

Over the years, I figured out that he was someone you could depend on, someone you could trust, someone I wanted to have at my side through all the hard parts of life and all the joyful ones. He is caring and honest, wise and kind, as our much loved daughters will testify -- and our beloved granddaughters, as well. We have a new grandson, too -- grandchildren, as well. {APPLAUSE} One of our granddaughters asked Dick not long ago if he knew anyone famous. {LAUGHTER} And I treasure the fact that she didn't know he was.

Dick first entered public life as "the gentleman from Wyoming." {APPLAUSE} And he loved his 10 years as our state's congressman. It was his privilege to serve as Secretary of Defense during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. {APPLAUSE} And it has been the highest honor for him to serve beside our President for the past four years. {APPLAUSE}

Ladies and gentlemen, my husband, the love of my life, Dick Cheney, the Vice President of the United States. {APPLAUSE}
