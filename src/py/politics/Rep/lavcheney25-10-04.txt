Well, thank you so much. What a great crowd, what a great welcome. Please sit down. What a beautiful day. As we drove over here, I couldn't help but think what a gorgeous part of the country you live in, the blue sky, and -- {APPLAUSE} It is wonderful. And we frequently -- it just frequently occurs to me how proud we all ought to be, to be Americans and live in this great country. {APPLAUSE}

Sometimes I think I'll make a list of all the things we have to be proud of. And if I were to do that, right at the top of it, I'd put our President, George W. Bush. {APPLAUSE} He has been a wonderful leader these past four years, and if you'll permit me to say so, the Vice President is no slouch either. {APPLAUSE}

Well, being here in Clinton County is a great thing. I understand it is Bush-Cheney country. {APPLAUSE} And we appreciate how hard you are working to get out every vote. We really do appreciate that. It's looking good. You look at -- it's going to be close, but we're a little bit ahead. That's kind of where you want to be, not a little bit ahead, a little bit ahead, right? But you see all these polls, and I got the most heartening news this morning from my 10-year-old granddaughter. Apparently, the Weekly Reader has conducted a poll every presidential election since 1956. They have never been wrong. And George W. Bush won by a landslide. {APPLAUSE}

Well, I get to introduce Dick because I have known him for so long. I have known him since he was 14 years old. This is true. And that summer when I first knew him, he was sweeping out the Ben Franklin store in Casper, Wyoming. That was his job. And I've known him through many jobs since. I've known him since he was digging ditches at the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo Grounds. And I've known him since he was loading bentonite -- 100-pound sacks of bentonite onto railroad cars. And I've known him since he was building power line all across the West to pay his way through school. And I like to tell those stories because I think when you grow up working hard, you learn some really important lessons. And one of those lessons is that the hard working people of this country ought to get to keep as much of their paychecks as possible. {APPLAUSE}

Well, I appreciated being introduced as a grandmother. I'm a grandmother -- I'm a mother. I don't see too many grandmothers here today, actually. Oh, okay, grandmother power is here. There are so many important elections -- issues in this election, so many things that I care about and I know you do, too, but when I think of it, I think first of my kids and my grandkids. And I think about keeping them safe, keeping them secure. And we all know -- in our realistic moments, we all know that the terrorists will try to come after us again. They'll try. And I ask myself when that happens, who do I want to have standing in the doorway protecting us. And I'll tell you it is not John Kerry. It is not John Edwards. It is George Bush. And, ladies and gentlemen, it is my husband, Dick Cheney, the Vice President of the United States. {APPLAUSE}
