Seth, thank you very much. Good job. Welcome to the South Lawn. Laura and I are thrilled you're here for opening day.

We want to welcome the coaches and the players. We want to welcome the moms and dads and grandparents here to this historic ballpark. And we're glad you're here to help us kick off the 2006 Tee Ball on the South Lawn season. General Pace and I expect there to be some pretty good competition today.
