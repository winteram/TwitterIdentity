Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. It's a great day to visit Daytona. I'm honored to be with all of you, and I bring greetings to you from the President. On Independence Day weekend, we're reminded how fortunate we are to live in freedom, and to call this nation our home. {APPLAUSE} We're grateful above all to the men and women who defend us. {APPLAUSE} And I'd like to ask all the members of our military and all of our veterans here tonight to stand and be recognized. {APPLAUSE} Now I want to say good luck to the drivers and the crews. Have a great race and a safe race. Thank you very much, and may God bless America. {APPLAUSE}
