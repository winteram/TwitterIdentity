I want to talk about a tax family that is with us today. The O'Keefe family. They're right down here in front. Dan and Laurie O'Keefe. They have got four wonderful children: Andrew, Oliver, Isaac, and little Anthony. They're here for a reason. I want to explain loud and clear what my vision for America does for people who are working hard to get ahead, the different points of view. This good family now pays $3,343 of federal income taxes -- $3,343. Under our vision, it says if you pay taxes, everybody gets relief, they will save $2,600 in taxes. {CHEERS ; APPLAUSE} That's $2,600 more in their pocket. But this isn't any great gift. It's their money to begin with. {CHEERS ; APPLAUSE} The surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money. It belongs to people like the O'Keefes. It's their money; it's your money. I know you've heard the rhetoric of this campaign about somehow we all stand on the side of the rich, that it's the rich and the powerful versus everybody else. We're going to reject that kind of class warfare in the year 2000. That kind of angry warfare has got to go. But I want to remind you who stands on the side of the people.

Under the Vice President's plan, the O'Keefe family, the hard-working O'Keefe family, receives a whopping $100 in tax relief. 

{BOOING} 

Think about that. Look at the difference. We've set our priorities. We've funded the priorities, but we believe that government should be limited. It should do a few things and do them well. And, instead of spending that $2600 on bigger bureaucracies, we want them to spend it on their own families. We trust them with their own money. We trust the O'Keefes and we trust you. That's exactly the difference in this campaign. Our campaign believes the American dream is available for every willing heart. Our campaign understands that you change hearts and souls one person and one conscience at a time, that government can hand out money but what it cannot do is put hope in a person's heart or friendship in a person's life. Government can't make people love one another. The great strength of America lies in the fact that our nation is full of compassionate people, loving people. 

My job will not only be to bring a legislative agenda-- it's the people's business-- to Washington D.C., my job will also be to call upon responsible behavior by our citizens, responsible behavior by our government, to lift this nation's spirits but to understand where it starts. I understand that it begins, that should I be the one when I put my hand on the Bible that day, should I be the one that after all your hard work I earn the confidence of the great American people, I swear to not only uphold the laws of the land but to answer the calls of the hundreds who have come to our rallies and held up pictures of their children so they can look me in a eye and say, "Governor, I'm here to tell you, never again, never let us down again to hear those voices, to call upon the best of America. I will also swear to uphold the honor and the integrity of the office to which I have been elected so help me God. Thank you all for coming. {CHEERS ; APPLAUSE} God bless.
