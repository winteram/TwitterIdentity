<h1> Title: Group Identities on Twitter</h1>

<h4> 1. The purpose of this research is: </h4>

<p> The groups with whom a person identifies are strongly tied to that person's emotions, beliefs, and behaviors.  In this study, we hope to accomplish two things.  The first is to build a system that uses a person's Twitter account to infer the groups with whom that person identifies.  For example, using a person's tweets we will guess whether the person identifies with a particular political party or sports team and how strongly they identify with the group.  The second goal of this research is to understand how a person's identifying groups affects his or her tendency to share certain kinds of information. If the natural hypothesis is correct, information should through networks of strongly identifying individuals.  So a news article on politics will be retweeted by those individuals who strongly identify with that political party, while a sports article tweeted by the same person will be retweeted by a different set of people who identify with that sports team.</p>

<h4> 2. The general plan of the research is: </h4>
<p> <em>We will collect information on the groups with whom Twitter users identify and how strongly they identify with these groups.</em> We will then collect those user’s public tweets and profile information, as well as the public tweets and profile information of their friends and followers.  We will use this information to build a model that attempts to predict the participants’ groups and how strongly they identify with those groups, and use these predictions to understand how different kinds of information flow through Twitter.  We will also ask those participants who agree to participate in an additional phase of the experiment to post a tweet containing information relevant to a particular group, so we can test the causal relationship between group identity and information flow. </p>

<h4> 3. The following procedures will be performed on those who participate in this research: </h4>

<p>If you agree to participate in the first part of this study, we will ask you to complete a survey about the group with whom you identify and how strongly you identify with those groups.  We will then crawl the public information on Twitter to obtain your recent tweets, your public profile information, and the public tweets and profile information of your friends and followers. <br />
If you agree to participate in the second part of the study, we will ask you to provide an email address where we can contact you.  In 1-3 months we will send an email asking you to post a tweet with a URL that will be relevant to some group (though not necessarily a group you identify with).  You may, of course, refuse to participate at any time.  We will then observe whether and how your followers share the information in the tweet. </p>
