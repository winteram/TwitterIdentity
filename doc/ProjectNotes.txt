1. use survey to find users' group identities, see if we can predict
identities from tweets; see if we can predict the strength of
identification.

2. see how information flows in overlapping networks of (e.g.) sports
networks and political networks, for high- versus low-identifiers

3. Similar clusters in the network are more likely to merge than very
disparate clusters

4. Reactions to outgroups

To predict:

How someone answers a survey
What kind of content they produce or share
Systemic view of reactions to events
Structural changes in the network
