1. use survey to find users' group identities, see if we can predict
identities from tweets; see if we can predict the strength of
identification.

2. see how information flows in overlapping networks of (e.g.) sports
networks and political networks, for high- versus low-identifiers

3. Similar clusters in the network are more likely to merge than very
disparate clusters

4. Reactions to outgroups

To predict:

How someone answers a survey
What kind of content they produce or share
Systemic view of reactions to events
Structural changes in the network



** Notes, WAM 5/14 **

We should make sure the URLs we give to each user is a unique bit.ly link, so we can track clicks

Give users in 2nd phase the chance to refuse to post the tweet / URL, record that as useful information

Maybe we should do a staged survey: 1. Ask to name one social group they highly identify with. 2. Ask survey questions about that group, political group, and national group.

For political groups, we need to allow for non-U.S. political parties?  Or only ask political ID questions for those who indicate they live in the United States.
