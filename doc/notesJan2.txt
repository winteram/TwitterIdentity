Ways to do classification:

TEXT FEATURES
=============
(unigram / bigram / trigram)
(own tweets, friends' tweets, followers' tweets)
(strength of tie?)
(we tweets)

1. Raw Deal
Feature vectors are counts or relative frequencies of words that have counts over 2 in entire corpus

2. LIWC categories
Calculate frequencies in LIWC categories (150) as features

3. Hashtags
Feature vectors are counts or relative frequencies of hashtags that have counts over 2 in entire corpus

4. URLs
Feature vectors are counts or relative frequencies of URLs / domain that have counts over 2 in entire corpus

5. High Frequency Raw deal
Feature vectors are counts or relative frequencies of words that have counts over 1000 (?) in entire corpus


EXTERNAL CORPUS FEATURES
========================
6. Cosine frequencies with different parties
Feature vector is cosine similarity with each party (length = 5)


NETWORK FEATURES
================
(strength of tie?)
* will have to crawl all users if verified using multiple keys

7. Network ties to verified entities
Feature vector is binary vector of length (all verified entities in database) representing direct connections to entities

8. Network ties to verified entities
Feature vector is vector of length (all verified entities in database) representing count of indirect connections to entities

9. Network ties to known entities
Feature vector is binary vector of length (pre-selected entities) representing direct connections to entities

10. Network ties to known entities
Feature vector is vector of length (pre-selected entities) representing count of indirect connections to entities



TO DO:

- Degree distributions
- Go through own identities and identify people who didn't understand the question
- Get tweets of users from database, do cosine similarity test
- Start coding to generate feature vectors for 1-6 (above)
