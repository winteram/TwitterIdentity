LDA on user's tweets:
    ? Num topics
    ? Top k words in topics
    ? Valence words within topics
    ? "we" words in topics
    
Words in tweets that contain "we" words (TF-IDF)
Words in tweets that contain "I" words (TF-IDF)


<<>>
For political & national identity, use word counts from predefined
dictionary to predict (multi-class SVM) identity & (regression) strength of
identification

For free-form identity, do topic modeling, pick key words from topic(s)
that have highest intersection with user-supplied terms and URL.  Measure
of success = jaccard coefficient / cosine similarity / AUC for LDA-words to
user-supplied terms.
