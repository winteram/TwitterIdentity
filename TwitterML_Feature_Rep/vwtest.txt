Alternatively to both I could go back to bed.

Always want to flip the picture out a window. And since I'm still angry from yesterday...

What can be so wrong with a person to shoot little kids.. @MikeyC_21 he's dead 18 kids.. Right before Christmas. I can't even imagine the families of those kids right now.. They got up and got ready for school, just like every other day... What the fuck is wrong with people. Kids.. That's the only thing I can think about right now is that someone could at a child and kill them.. My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families, and all those involved. This breaks my heart. These kids didn't even understand the world yet, they were so innocent.. So sick to my stomach right now. I don't wanna live on this planet anymore. I can't watch this coverage without crying. When it comes down to it, if some psycho wants to get into a school and do that, they will. Nothing can stop them.. And that's the sad thing And the even sadder thing is, some other sick fuck is probably going to copy-cat this. This whole thing makes me sick. @YourRomeo_ a school in Newtown, Connecticut There's a very special place in Hell for a sick fuck like Ryan Lanza. I have no connection with anyone involved, but I seriously cannot stop crying now watching this. How can you TARGET a KINDERGARTEN class? 20 kids dead.. 20. How can you look at a child and take their innocence, their life away? How can you take them away from their family? @millimariee well it turns out that wasn't really the guy @baileydawson94 that seriously makes me sick @tayhelvie text me! @alyyjeannxo that's such a rip off ! haha @SarahMfShores #groupielove Still can't believe/remember @SarahMfShores included me in that snapchat she took ?????? @SarahMfShores I was so confused, I thought it was for IG! hahah @konibby likes to make fun of my shorts ?????? @konibby shhhh ?????? @konibby ???????????? heeeyyyyyy @konibby guess what? ? @konibby you're beautiful ???????

I ate my twin in the womb Idk if it's just me, but when someone does something I find unattractive, it's really hard for me to look past that. I know I'm not perfect, and I don't live to be. But before you start pointing fingers, make sure your hands are clean. Some say go to the light, others say you must leave it. But in darkness there's clarity, even if you don't care to see it. Same story, different page. Same shit, different day. @_HerCowboy right on ???????????? I wish I could shut my mind off at night Sometimes I feel that I should find a relationship. And then I think, hmm.. better not I'm a ghost and you know this, that's why we broke up in the first place. I always miss my brother ?????? If you try to purposely make me mad/jealous, I will automatically lose all respect for you.

Weird that snoop just rapped about Ali and Frazier while I'm typing a paper about them right now Saw a black guy in a Ben Davis Cross Country sweatshirt but it wasn't @MaryHammm :( @MaryHammm yea! @MaryHammm pretty damn good, big things to come for #USITF? @ReJ3ctz #CR33ZTAPE tho #gameday #BeatUNC Can't get anything done, too hyped for UNC game tonight, lets goooo @ryanvelmer The top 8 Big Ten teams are better than every SEC team except UK and Florida, and we play most of them twice a year Watching the Jimmy V speech for the second time today #inspiring Laugh, Think, and Cry every day 6/9 of the trends right now have to do with the #IUBB game #HoosierNation Granted no PJ Hariston, granted at Assembly Hall, we still banged the number 14 team in the nation 24 Also, no Hanner, Peter, or Elston and Watford and Yogi had 2 points each We know we can win at home, or on a neutral court, I want a road win. Still ecstatic about tonight, but not getting ahead of myself I like tweeting about IU because of all the people that it pisses off Also, Roy Williams gets to ride the plane home thinking about how Noah Vonleh will be in candy stripes next year and not Jordan's #iubb @_peydro sowee @I_AM_aFISH9 UK tried that and lost @Brooks_Logan thanks, I think the same way about you and UK, actually you're probably smarter than me One last IU tweet for now: if you are doubting Hollowell you don't know basketball. When we get hanner perer and Derek back it will be like Getting Hollowell back because he will be able to move to a more natural position at the three. I look for big things from him in the B1G “@MattyTress_1: http://t.co/NhQuZtlY is amazing” @insidethehall I think this kids bills letter jacket may actually be more embarrassing than a high school letter jacket @FO_RILLoMurillo he's wearing a bills jacket, probably a pussy @MattyTress_1 @gmraynor MacaWho? @MattyTress_1 @gmraynor Roy Williams wears Cargos and listens to Nickleback All that money, the money is the motive On a Weeknd kick lately @k_vea or draft the other and have both @Brooks_Logan I don't have a ticket, take me with you Duke isn't the best team, just has the best resume.

But I think my dad is better looking. I'm biased though so don't take my word for it http://t.co/Xoxpahao @Bbow92 THAT I AM YOUR FAVORITE! @Bbow92 you didn't know we were telepathic? Currently posted up in wells library reflecting upon the fact that finals are over and just realized that I don't need to be in here at all. I have mad problems How did I even end up here @JBrowniess ? ahhhh!!! I'm like excited for you... Eyooooo Pittsburgh what's gucci @daniellestoebe yeah I love you @kroesch3 JUST LANDED!! @kroesch3 it's happening. There's no turning back now @luised07 i always knew that was your song "but to me this looks like a meth sandwich" "I just have to look good, not like a Ukrainian dentist" "and here I was picking blue yarn to match your eyes when I should have been picking black yarn to match your heart" Almost cried seeing stripe sleeping in Maura's bed... Needless to say he's now back in mine. Order has been restored @benswaby42 I'll come with @Bbow92 finally you see it @upinHERR HAHAHAHAHA "I'ma tell you right now my heart is beating like a phone book in a drier" @daniellestoebe ok @yariaquisi HAHAHA I think I maaaay have an idea I like favoriting people's subtweets as if I have every idea as to what they're talking about @Hairymeas buy me some #zzzzquil for Christmas? Just woke up @Hairymeas make it the nicest looking present you've ever given @scottch_tape and I are waiting for you @benswaby42............ @daniellestoebe I literally can't even wait You know it's gonna be a good day when Chuck Norris is straight Pamela's chillin with you and @scottch_tape @katiemcgrane Hahahaha yesss! It's actually happening though. My favorite is when Ellen starts crawling somewhere really ambitiously, gives up halfway and just rolls onto her back I fall in love with people's passion. The way their eyes light up when they talk about the thing they love and the way they fill with light Sitting at a light where no one is moving is honestly the most awkward thing.. Or is that just me It's like I have the worlds worst or the worlds best ideas... Never in that gray area Rebel Wilson is honestly my favorite Love like rain, like the smell of a tangerine, like a surprise found in your pocket @ohnikiyousofine just casually thinking about your roommate sitch... What if she's cooler than you #watchugondo @ohnikiyousofine or what if they fuck it up (possible) and its a boy? #watchugondo @ohnikiyousofine OR what if she's Indian too? So much brown power in one contained space. #watchugondo @ohnikiyousofine maybe shell be my new favorite person and I start sleeping in your room.. But to hang with her #watchugondo @ohnikiyousofine what If @izzortiz hates her? #watchugondo @ohnikiyousofine and I do realize you're sleeping (who sleeps though.. L0L) but that doesn't mean I dont expect responses in the mornin @ohnikiyousofine Peace. Love. New roommates @ohnikiyousofine and I miss you.., #watchugondo @ThomasthuTrain @ohnikiyousofine completely irrelevant cause you ducked up the hastag #nicetry @ohnikiyousofine @thomasthutrain HAHAHAHA nooooo @ohnikiyousofine I'll die @KoolAid_an ahh northern Ireland!

But yeah that's why he didn't even bother to comment on that default... #getitgirl @ThomasthuTrain only if you laugh at all my favorite YouTube videos And when they let you down, shifting from where you've carefully placed them, it shakes your faith, right where you stand. @KoolAid_an ...it was just to spite you actually @TaylorHiers NO YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET MORE BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!! @ohnikiyousofine @izzortiz only if I can have the middle piece doe Happy birthday shout out to my girl @TaylorHiers!!!!!!!! 19 and #beautiful Iz Christmas eve y'all the only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open @KentDevaney hahaha hey kent, but what if it doesn't? @KentDevaney then so be it sahhhhn! @KentDevaney Tis my advice.

@mnoonie93. Next year I can whisper down the hall instead of tweet :) It breaks my heart every time I come across your old emails. I miss you so much Ellen. Earth's just not the place for an angel like you #rip Thank you @NateBruggeman and @boyd_scout for interrupting my nap time. Didn't even have a plan of action... #disappointing @courtney_rowe such a dilemma!!! ;) @bonniemailey GET YOUR PEPPER SPRAY READY! I want to be whole, I want to be anything. We live and learn and let go. #np @courtney_rowe you me at six ;) In my opinion, obnoxious gum chewers/gum poppers are on the same level as terrorists. @BaileySAMuelson they're up there too @courtney_rowe it's like you're listening to my iPod today! I love having lunch with my brother on Mondays and Wednesdays. We have the strangest conversations. #DontTellMom I feel like such a little kid, rushing through my homework so I can go play with my friends. @boyd_scout @bonniemailey Thank you @mnoonie93 for inviting me to Bible study tonight :) that was exactly what I've been needing @NateBruggeman ???? You're weird. Bringing the party to Carmel @boyd_scout @kelsimus_prime @baileySAMuelson @mnoonie93 @NateBruggeman @__SwaggDaddy__ @danielscottrose Going to see Sinister. I am going to shit myself. @DianaPeinadoB hahaha yes!!! I forgot about that :) Nothing feels like fall quite like a visit to Stuckey Farm :) If America runs on Dunkin and @kelsimus_prime runs Dunkin, does Kelsey run America? I love how the trees and grass glow as the sun sets #fall &lt;3 Carmel football game. Trying to remember what it feels like to have a powerhouse football team I love the place that I'm at and the people in my life right now. For the first time in a long time I feel like I belong somewhere. Having @bonniemailey withdrawals @bonniemailey I'm about to eat my feelings from how my I miss you Going to Abuelo's just isn't the same when @Tmartinez21 isn't there I love @courtney_rowe more than she loves cats!!!!!!!!! #bestfriendz @Crow_Hop hated that movie! so scary... @Crow_Hop what?! It was terrifying! My mom said it was nice to hear @courtney_rowe and I talking and laughing at home again last night, she's missed that. I have too. #home &lt;3 Hahah I had a whole conversation with Coby Fleener over the summer and just realized who he is. #Colts @cballone haha he's huge! But yeah he wasn't bad looking Rice and beans #TheHungerChallenge When I was a kid, Bob Saget and Bill Nye the science guy were the same person in my mind. @boyd_scout In the latest e-mail from my math professor he invited us to go watch his jazz quartet.... I know @PaigeGrumme will be there haha ;) 1 year since losing one of the nicest, most talented guys I've ever met in racing, @danwheldon. Thinking of Susie and their boys today. "So my foot's totally stuck in there right? I'm freaking out, the dog's having a seizure, and I still got half a pie left." #DrakeAndJosh Well I sized you up, you're not that strong. You're weak inside, I knew all along. This debate makes me want to punch myself in the face. I just have to decide if I want to use my left hand or my right hand. #debates @NateBruggeman poor guy... he'll probably comfort himself with his drugs now. Better get your gas mask ready I've felt tall lately which is weird cuz I'm short. @__SwaggDaddy__ @CourtneyK_21 @boyd_scout @NateBruggeman @danielscottrose can't drink with lids anymore The more you know who you are and what you want, the less you let things upset you @AJnyny ahhh I can't :( I'm sorry. I have so much to do tonight. I'm freaking out about it @AJnyny I wanted to go but I couldn't swing it. I'm SO nervous for this test :( My neighbors sent me brownies and money. My parents better step up their game @DDo311 I only give money to people who appreciate my tweets @DDo311 ouch... that's cold :( @DDo311 I know you actually love my tweets @DDo311 that was one time. What was wrong with it? I'm funny @DDo311 rude. No brownies for you @ChelseanLately @DDo311 wow thanks Chelsea. Thought you'd have my back... Paranormal Activity 4. I'm gonna look like those people in the commercials Mark Wahlberg. I'd do him. #RightHereRightNow I spilled my Skittles all over that theater I just showered in my slippers.... I wear my slippers where I want, when I want. Coconut Head &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 @kelsimus_prime @baileySAMuelson @DDo311 how dare you touch our birthday calendar @ChelseanLately @DDo311 hahah oh Chelsea... I'll have to tell you about my morning while we redo our bulletin board Just another guy that thinks he owns me. #lol #dumbass This cat's name is Tard, no wonder he looks pissed all the time @courtney_rowe http://t.co/sgJy6g1C For every male in my family there is a black professional athlete with the same name. So yeah Chris Johnson is my dad. @courtney_rowe hahaha well that's embarrassing ;) I'm a stitch away from making it and a scar away from falling apart @KelsiMorris22 hahahah time for an intervention?? "Kelsey what are you majoring in?" "Dogs. And magic." @kelsimus_prime @ChelseanLately @KelsiMorris22 cutest dwarf on the floor @KelsiMorris22 @ChelseanLately sorry I'll try to control myself @KennyGriffey hell yeah! Spicy buffalo Wheat Thins are so tasty @__SwaggDaddy__ @kelsimus_prime @NateBruggeman family toilet flushing ceremony? It was so good to see @lkmcginness!! Miss her so much Since when is common courtesy a foreign concept...? #PrayForShannon Bears. #MondayNightFootball Debate time. I better get off twitter before I unfollow everyone It was just one of those days. :/ "All I know of tomorrow if that God will rise before the sun." Why do I even bother anymore @ChelseanLately haha sure we can talk when you get back from class! My life is 100x better with @NateBruggeman in it. #truth The autumn leaves falling down like pieces in their place Really miss my guitar. I haven't played in a while I love @NateBruggeman and @kelsimus_prime needs to back off my man! We're getting married &lt;3 It's my future husband @NateBruggeman http://t.co/XN2EQjjZ "Everyone has a past, but that's just it - it's in the past. You can learn from it, but you can't change it." #SafeHaven "@WaytoHighGuyy: Can't read the words on the drive-thru menu. Turns down radio." @courtney_rowe this guy. 84 favorties and 154 retweets. How's that for stepping up my twitter game @DDo311? This hot chocolate doesn't meet the demands of my caffeine addiction. If Ryan Reynolds sneezed on me I'd say thank you Is there a way that I could just donate my body fat to the starving kids in Africa? @bonniemailey @boyd_scout @NateBruggeman @__SwaggDaddy__ @mnoonie93 anything for you Bonnie :) I miss him http://t.co/VpvDI9jh "I don't actually follow him but Bill Nye retweeted it." - @boyd_scout You only think you have a good relationship with someone until you play them in Super Smash Bros. @__SwaggDaddy__ I didn't want to fight you Carter It's a little unsettling to watch them pour the "fresh" fruit out of a bag in the dining hall If you drink orange juice with pulp, you might as well just eat an orange. "I'm not going to lie to you and say that I've never wanted to punch a child in the face." Haha @__SwaggDaddy__ I forget to blink when I play video games. "The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still." - Exodus 14:14 Too old to trick or treat, too young to die @ChelseanLately people very grudgingly give candy to a nineteen yr old on Halloween haha #TalkLikeYourBestFriend "Omg I love cats! Glitter! Phone Cases! Meow. @SammyAdams please do me! CATS!!!!!!" @courtney_rowe ;) @courtney_rowe I like to think so :) No shave November! I wonder how long my beard will get... #jk #nobeard #imalady Creepy Colombian guy hitting on me via facebook. Sólo habla español también. Es muy extraño! I like this reverse trick or treat thing. Residents of Wright Quad, bring me more candy! @ChelseanLately people kept coming to my room! S/o to @bonniemailey for being an awesome friend :) #loveyou! If I took the time that I use to plan out my procrastination and use it to actually do my work, I wouldn't have to procrastinate Rest my eyes for a minute, fall asleep for 3 hours. Heading to Assembly Hall. Hoosier basketball time! #ThisIsIndiana #iubb http://t.co/ZPfwz7rM I love stories like these http://t.co/omzBZJHg RIP Mitch "@MitchLuckerSS: Partying with my boo boo! We know how to do the monster mash better then you do! #truelove http://t.co/2VRjsxkI" Two years clean (and counting). To everyone that's supported me and helped keep me going, thank you so much. I couldn't do it without you Happy birthday Ellen. Miss you every day Might have just seen @Sloney_Bologna at Fresh Market but I didn't want to go up and say hi and be wrong.. #embarrassing @Sloney_Bologna haha that was you then! I should've said hi. I left too though My cousin's xbox girlfriend is coming to Thanksgiving. XBox Live &gt; Eharmony "Listen to God and listen to yourself. Don't listen to everyone else, you'll never be able to satisfy them." My dad's a smart man. #respect I just want to watch the Bears game :( You can make fun of how Andrew Luck looks all you want but his girlfriend is 100x prettier than yours. #justsayin "@ReallyFatAmy: No, I'm not high or drunk. Believe it or not, this is my personality." @baileySAMuelson @kelsimus_prime @msass18 no te gusta español? Es mi clase favorita! @__SwaggDaddy__ hahaha wow I totally thought that when completely sober one time @ChelseanLately @DDo311 I'll help! @ChelseanLately @DDo311 I'm a pro at making turkeys with my hands I'll definitely help @ChelseanLately it's not something you can explain, you just know when you reach pro status @ChelseanLately haha wait what tweet? And who? @ChelseanLately oh! Hahah right okay! When you don't feel good never google your symptoms. Comes up as cancer every time Out of everything political, we're arguing about gerrymandering. @bonniemailey @__SwaggDaddy__ @NateBruggeman @danielscottrose @CourtneyK_21 iPad mini? If you're in a situation where your iPhone is too small but your iPad is too big, please reevaluate your life. @zSwEiN62 #NObama* ;) Absolutely (Story of a Girl) will ALWAYS be a good song. If you didn't cry when Gabriella told Troy she had to go her own way...don't talk to me. @msass18 you seem like you're good at spanish though. I was NOT focused while studying tonight so I'm crossing my fingers for tomorrow If you don't vote, don't complain about the outcome of the next 4 years. "Do you think Jimmy John's would deliver me a sandwich here?" - guy in front of me in this long ass line to vote Apparently a spot in line is not a valid delivery location for Jimmy John's. How ridiculous It's funny how the people who preach about tolerance are some of the most intolerant people. @boyd_scout @BaileySAMuelson aww p-money... what a sweetheart! @hardy_hart wish I didnt need the same amount of hours of sleep as a 6 yr old "What luck for rulers that men do not think." @NateBruggeman for about 2 seconds I thought you were pretty funny "I can't explain what I mean. And even if I could, I'm not sure I'd feel like it." - J.D. Salinger "You only get one life, for a very short time. So make every second divine." #SS #MitchLucker Peanut butter is more of a distraction to me than anything Taking racquetball with @boyd_scout next semester. #woop Watching P.S. I Love You while crying my eyes out and eating my weight in chocolate. #GirlMoment @kylieb234 hahah it's the perfect movie for it @AJnyny hey what'd I miss in psych? @ChelseanLately ahh dang it I keep forgetting!!! I will for sure tell you sometime soon! The lake is a little sketchy at night. But the stars are sooo prettyy. #stargazing Can't wait to go home for a week next Friday for Thanksgiving. I need some time away from b-town. Your love never fails, it never gives up, never runs out on me Saw Victor Oladipo. Didn't ask him for a picture because no one cares @boyd_scout I agree. Go us haha. But seriously, they're just people. And in a few years everyone will forget they even exist @boyd_scout of course, it's Mark Wahlberg! Scouting out the food court, trying to find a guy that'll buy us Qdoba @kelsimus_prime @mnoonie93 @boyd_scout What month is it? @jmpearson716 we need to get a group together and hang out!!! I'm still mad at Jamie Lynn Spears for getting pregnant and ruining Zoey 101. CZ #iubb "This thing could have won the civil war." "It's a t-shirt cannon, chill out." Haha @bonniemailey #iubb @kelsimus_prime it's the perfect size for your hands. I'd say that's worth $2 The song "Cinderella" by Steven Curtis Chapman came on my Pandora station and now I'm a teary mess and miss my dad ? @cballone Devin Hester kick off return for a touchdown ?? If @funkadelicc is coming back to Indy for Thanksgiving, we better find time to go to Panera! @funkadelicc noooo!! I miss you too :( Panera's probably going out of business without us "For I am the LORD your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you." Isaiah 41:13 @AJnyny haha I gave up and went to bed early. I have A's on all the tests so far so if I do bad on this one that'll be the one I drop Had a terrible dream that the girls on my floor were trying to pierce my ears. Oh wait... that really happened. Happy National Diabetes Awareness Day to my fav diabetic, @Strom_Qui_Qui!! ;) love you, see you friday! @cballone aw thanks Cassie ;) I haven't seen my brother all week :( I miss him #bestfriend http://t.co/niXlSMO2 @leeannasue @JDieselParenti I'm so sorry for your loss. You're all in my thoughts and prayers ? Nothing feels better than finishing Spanish every week after having it at 8am four straight days "Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right." - Henry Ford @jmpearson716 it's the thought that counts hahah @TREY_Or_False14 @Crow_Hop Christian Watford only won an ESPY, nbd @TREY_Or_False14 @Crow_Hop yeah my brother was here for that game. He was hyped. I'd say the team's even more solid this yr they'll be good 1000 points, Jordan Hulls! #iubb #ThisIsIndiana @TREY_Or_False14 @Crow_Hop dang that sucks. Game of the century for Hoosiers Waiting for my brother to finish classes before heading to Carmel. Soooo boreddddd. Someone come play with me Now that McDonald's put the calorie counts on their menu, their food is even less appealing. Gully :) http://t.co/vtiunHPT Really.... we're going to hoard Twinkies? Gross. Really want to get some awesome Christmas sweaters this week Happy birthday @ChelseanLately!! I'm so glad we live on the same floor, you always make me laugh :) Have an awesome day! @ChelseanLately omg I keep forgetting!! It'll happen just keep reminding me haha Skies are blue and I'm alive so all is well Guy that treated me like shit said I need to lower my standards for a relationship to work. Hahah guys like u remind me why I have standards Bridges of Hope banquet. I'm getting excited for my mission opportunities in 2013 in Guatemala and Colombia Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. http://t.co/fHDYjlVp Your clothes never wear as well the next day and your hair never falls in quite the same way I have 2 papers I need to work on. Sounds like the perfect time to watch all the Bourne movies start to finish @kylieb234 Cassadee Pope ?????? Dez is super attractive though ? "I'm not anyone's first choice or anyone's favorite. People tell me I mean a lot to them but there's someone they'll always choose over me." The Bears do this every season. They get off to a good start but then key players get injured and they fall apart. So frustrating @courtney_rowe pretty much how it goes I've missed @_gocarol so much. Even though we don't live down the street from each other anymore, she's always there for me #bff4life Why does Hollowell get so much playing time? He can barely dribble the ball and turns it over every time he touches it. Jordan Hulls is an incredible shooter and such a smart player. If he was better at defense he'd be unbelievable. Jack Taylor just sounds like the ultimate ball hog to me. "This is the only picture from the trip where my kids are smiling... when some black dude gave them a hug." #ShitMyAuntSays Giordano's pizza! &lt;3 @boyd_scout i'm full after one piece hahah @boyd_scout you don't have to be hungry to eat Out of 15 people we couldn't all agree on a movie so my uncle got Magic Mike. Weird, but I'm okay with it. The fight for the bathroom's getting intense. My aunt just body checked my cousin's wife into the wall. Happy Thanksgiving!!! So many blessings and reasons to be thankful. God is so good. Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Mark Sanchez just ran into the ass of a player on his own team, fumbled the ball, and the Patriots took it back for a TD. Where's Tebow?? LOL at the Jets. If you blink you'll miss a New England touchdown. I just want my daddy to not be sick :( Hi, I saw this in your ad...would you mind pointing me to the right isle? http://t.co/5MJ32ISP @kylieb234 rosa parks? Haha what? @kylieb234 ohhh hey I saw him first! You have to see the car to call shotgun :P My uncle is sitting here trying to say that golf is better than basketball. Are you freakin kidding me?! Thank God he's not a blood relative Spotted Jon McLaughlin at church Got to see a ton of people this week. It's always good to be home Back to B-town. Just have to power through these next three stressful weeks and then I'll have three weeks off. #ICanDoThis The Colombian guy that always hits on me just called me his love... I am not your anything! Go awayyyy @DianaPeinadoB hahaha I don't even know him! Christmas tree! #IU #Hoosiers http://t.co/pW8wC6D6 Feel better @joegilham10! @joegilham10 haha I know I thought you were going to throw up "Hitting the gym to release stress is not nearly as effective as hitting the people that cause the stress to begin with." #amen @baileySAMuelson and @kelsimus_prime are giggling at pictures of otters If you use my colored pencils you better put them back in rainbow order Cody Zeller has the most adorable parents &lt;3 It's good to be a #hoosier. #iubb Using peanut butter to bribe myself to keep studying. The more I study psychology, the more I feel like I'm either severely chemically imbalanced or just really really weird. Can't get anything done with @baileySAMuelson snapchatting me every 2 mins Pick yourself up off the ground. You're sure as hell too good to let them hold you down. #atl My dad called to tell me my dog has gone into a deep depression since I came back to school and just stays in his crate all day. #crying @shaylinrose he was like "he doesn't see the point of living when you're gone. So he's basically suicidal." :'((( so sad!! There's a man outside of Woodburn that's yelling at the squirrels. You would think with 2 weeks left in the semester I would know by now when my Friday discussion starts... #nope There's no "we" in pizza. "Something fell out of the Santa hat and broke and I was afraid it was the donkey from the nativity scene." - Janet @boyd_scout @zSwEiN62 take it back. http://t.co/iicLSArN Scaring strangers with demon santa @boyd_scout http://t.co/6hLflVy5 Just saw @mnoonie93 in the Nutcracker and she was so amazing!! Chris Evans... hot damn. *NSync pandora @kelsimus_prime @bonniemailey @mnoonie93 Hey @czeller40, want to come and help me hang my Christmas lights? #CantReach People are sooo dumb today. But the children love the books... Finished one of the hardest, most stressful weeks I've ever had. Now my plan for the day is to lay in bed and watch movies. @datCanadianGirl I've been craving apples and peanut butter all day. @datCanadianGirl so freakin good! I want some @KelsiMorris22 10 on CBS @KelsiMorris22 vs fashion show! I just saw a commercial and then saw your tweet haha @ChelseanLately i found one on the floor! "Please believe that things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough." - Stephen Chbosky If Jenelle from Teen Mom 2 can find someone that's willing to spend the rest of their life with her, so can you. @NateBruggeman what a baby I used to think soy milk was a spanish brand of milk that translated to "I am milk." ...I was really smart. Me: "How'd you like the place I'm looking at?" Dad: "Does it really have all those pools?" Praying for my dad's surgery today. Hoping this solves the problem and he'll finally feel better. This week is gonna swallow me, but when it spits me out I'm landing on my feet. #TheWonderYears Just signed our first lease. Celebrating with Taco Bell. @kelsimus_prime @baileySAMuelson @jessledyard hahaha I know how much you love Taco Bell. I'll be at Campus Corner next August! "Have you ever really danced on the edge? Just hold my hand and jump." #ptv #np Good talk with @shaylinrose into the wee hours of the morning. Brought me back to sophomore year of high school haha 95% of my socks are single and you don't see them crying about it. Austin Etherington is the man #iubb Praying for @austin13e to have a speedy recovery After going to the game, watching Pineapple Express, taking a shower &amp; reading up on Mark Wahlberg's life, it's time to stop procrastinating There are velveta shells in the water fountain. @NateBruggeman Finite, if I wanted to hate myself at 10am I would just eat a donut. Putting on Cartoon Network before this final is like making an old person comfortable in a retirement home before they die. Water is so tasty for not having a taste @KelsiMorris22 I'm just reading your mind through the wall right now What a lucky guy @NateBruggeman is for getting my white elephant gift. #snuggie #gnome http://t.co/3vtzhmRN @msass18 .........kinda hate you right now. I'm pretty smart but I manage to be pretty dumb. Being blonde definitely has its perks ;) @cbalogna hahaha Love my floor &lt;3 http://t.co/XJYvU9Vw "Do you ever feel like a plastic bag; able to carry groceries, but also able to strangle and kill a small child?" @__SwaggDaddy__ @__SwaggDaddy__ haha well no one is, it's sarcasm Bitches acting like they own the lounge... #stfu @baileySAMuelson So we're just going to accept that one of our hands is just worse at everything? @AJnyny yeah tomorrow it is. I took my test in the room next door today Hey @zSwEiN62! What's up? Haha No reason to stay is a good reason to go Really wish the 2 hot guys that were staring at us at dinner would have made a move! #NoBalls @bonniemailey @AJnyny it's all on oncourse! The unit test was hard, I didn't have to take the final I seriously have the nicest neighbors. They gave me brownies and money at Halloween and for Christmas they gave me a tree, candy, and money I am so awkward, I just want to punch myself in the face right now. Can't believe it's been 5 yrs since I lost one of my best friends to leukemia. It still hurts like it was yesterday. Miss you so much Ellen. #Home ?????????????????? I just want to watch Prison Break right now. @kelsimus_prime @NateBruggeman well good, you can stay there since you didn't come say bye. #jerk @NateBruggeman I was packing! You were just "as hungry as a fat chick on the first week of her new diet" When you have today, you should say all that you have to say. #sws #np @NateBruggeman now I'm dying of a broken heart. Why hasn't a clear toaster been made? That way you could see how done your toast is. Tired of burnt toast, someone needs to make this happen Butler put up a fight and were the better team today. I have nothing but respect for Brad Stevens and his team, so congrats to Butler In light of recent events, it would be silly to be upset about losing today. You win some and you lose some. Still love my team though #IUBB Qdoba and Mark Wahlberg. 2 of my favorite things @zSwEiN62 whatever... I think it's time to say bye to Lovie. Mom told me to come downstairs cuz dinner was ready. I came down and dinner wasn't even ready. Sick of all these lies... The Jonas Brothers have been to the year 3000, there's no way we're dying on Friday I better get to go to Panera with @funkadelicc while home for break! @funkadelicc sounds good to me! Ned Bigby peaked in middle school I love Cassadee Pope. I really hope she wins The Voice, she deserves it Thank you @Strom_Qui_Qui and Heather for bringing me Starbucks tonight! Missed them so much. Made my night :) Where did this bruise on my hand come from? I'm so delicate. Hate when my dog decides to be a little asshole at 5:30am. #GoToSleep! Typical Carmel moms going to the grocery store in their corvettes @Sloney_Bologna hahaha I played that on gamecube all the time in like 5th grade. Makin some titty cookies!! #MerryChristmas @_gocarol Spent the day baking cookies with my favorite ladies :) loved catching up with them @NateBruggeman @boyd_scout gayyyyy @boyd_scout @NateBruggeman gross Rachel... pervert Dez Duron, there's a special spot for you under my Christmas tree. @boyd_scout @NateBruggeman that's right Spicy Tuna Saw @CassadeePope live in 2009 and thought she was amazing. I'm glad America now sees how amazing she is too. So happy she won The Voice! The day I learn to fly I'm never coming down. #RiseAgainst #HeavenKnows I want it to snow!! The guy next to me at the dentist had 2 cavities. The lady cleaning my teeth turned to me and whispered, "...he goes to Purdue." "You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget." - Jessica, age 8 @dianalarosaydg high school will be over before you know it and all those people will be behind you. Trust me it DOES get better! The space in between the driver's seat and middle console is like a black hole. I thought hurricane season was over My Colombian admirer can't take a hint. #PleaseStop Road rage is flaring. I'm about to turn into the hulk. #OutOfMyWay Facebook's hitting on me. http://t.co/At9f9OZF $219 for a textbook through the bookstore?? Try $33 off ebay. #boom My night: The neighbors made me pot roast, I got free Starbucks, and I made $200. ?????? @_MelisssaAnnn hahah I know him and it's his phone that does it. It's frustrating to him too @leeannasue aw.. well it depends on the book. And how cheap the people that are buying it are haha Reading by the Christmas tree ???????????? @zSwEiN62 Qdoba ???????????? @zSwEiN62 I'm actually about to go get some Qdoba now :) thanks for inspiring my lunch @AJnyny @Mandel19 @zSwEiN62 whatever... Qdoba has the best queso Tom Cruise is just a Mark Wahlberg wannabe Has anyone seen the Full House twins lately?! Damn http://t.co/vIwfOGwq Looks like I'll have classes with 2 guys I grew up with, a guy who thinks I'm a slut, @boyd_scout, Peter Jurkin and Jordan Hulls' sister #IU So here I am alive at last, and I'll savor every moment of this. #TheUsed My uncle added rum to his coke at the movie theater haha Watched all the Lord of the Rings movies and saw The Hobbit today. Feeling a little drained @boyd_scout @__SwaggDaddy__ I've seen all the LOTR movies like 10 times, I'll still watch them with you guys!! ...on second thought, I'll just use a gift bag. Have a merry Christmas ladies! @KelsiMorris22 @hanareed @Jiggle_MyJugs @ChelseanLately @HolaCynthiaa @kick_my_rick @AliCharles124 @LadiLalov So the elves spend the whole year making the toys, but Santa gets to put his name on them? That's fair... Christmas service! Candle lighting and "Silent Night" is my favorite part of Christmastime :) #MerryChristmas! "Long lay the world in sin and error pining til He appeared and the soul felt its worth." "A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices, for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn." As the Christmases get "simpler" I enjoy them more. I'm just thankful for the family and friends I get to share them with Blizzard warning? There can't be a blizzard, I'm going to Chili's with @baileySAMuelson and @mnoonie93 tomorrow! Oh and Patrick. #PMoney @kelsimus_prime @BaileySAMuelson @mnoonie93 kelsey I miss you!! But none of us might be going since we're supposed to get 10-15 in of snow:( @kelsimus_prime YAY! Okay! We'll see how the weather is. I'll holla back atcha tomorrow girl Josh just said his dream job is to be a bench NBA player. You get paid to sit court side and watch people play basketball haha @ChelseanLately I got a toilet plunger with polka dots on it @ChelseanLately I have an apartment for next year and I guess when my cousin got his first apartment he didn't buy one but needed it haha @ChelseanLately you never know! But yeah I got some other stuff too haha @ChelseanLately we had a functional Christmas so I didnt get a lot either. Nail polish, Friday Night Lights season 4, and some kitchen stuff I'm not saying all guys are assholes, I just have a knack for finding the ones that are. Wish I could have parked my car in the garage before the blizzard hit yesterday, but my dad has too many fireworks... The microwave is faster but the oven makes it taste better We found your stolen prius, it was voting for Ralph Nadar When a sophomore in high school won't leave you alone cuz she's insecure and thinks you want her boyfriend... HAHAHA @courtney_rowe #DescribeYourLifeWithAPicture http://t.co/b1d4MyHL Thank God for music. Growing up scares me, but not growing up scares me even more. Thank you so much @Strom_Qui_Qui! You're so thoughtful and I'm so glad to have a friend like you. You're such a blessing in my life Ok snow, you've had your fun... The Bears have to win and the Vikings have to lose #fingerscrossed I don't make people feel bad for liking what they like, because my parents didn't raise me in the jungle No wonder I have anxiety issues Those pathetic people in infomercials is a pretty accurate representation of me today. Never liked you anyway Packers Hoping for the best for the Colts in the playoffs since my team's out. And Andrew Luck and Coby Fleener did come to my birthday haha Someone come make pancakes with me @zSwEiN62 COME RIGHT NOW @zSwEiN62 I CAN'T WAIT 5 DAYS I WANT PANCAKES RIGHT NOW @zSwEiN62 useless... The maturity level of some people at this age is a bit ridiculous. Let's act like adults here, I don't think that's not much to ask for. Forget having a new year's kiss, I just had the best donut ever. @Strom_Qui_Qui @huddastwom Let's just say I have a lot of work to do before spring break ?????? #yikes @datCanadianGirl Mean Girls ?????? Since it's 1am I'm playing my electric guitar with it unplugged but it's just not the same. It sounds like I'm flossing my teeth to a rhythm All I want right now is some simply orange and some fruit breezers #sick Adam Levine could sing the phone book and I'd still pay to go and listen. So @CourtneyK_21 got a Tom Daley calendar while I got a calendar of squirrels. There will be a little something for everyone this semester This is the second time this week I had an awesome dream but I thought it was real so I almost tweeted about it Can't eat solid foods, all we have is solid foods. #sohungry "The reason why bad things happen to you is because you're a dumbass." #That70sShow @__SwaggDaddy__ vitamin water after brushing your teeth might be worse than orange juice after brushing your teeth I can't think of a worse way to spend 90 mins of my life than seeing the new Texas Chainsaw movie in 3D I love late at night when everyone's asleep and it's just me and my music Most people don't even realize when they're hurting someone. Or they do but they're too wrapped up in themselves to care @courtney_rowe met him, had lunch with him, he's nothing special I hate when people clap at the end of movies. Or when the plane lands I love my mom ? That was just what I needed before going back to IU tomorrow. #GodIsGood @kick_my_rick I feel even more weird when they say they want to be a gynecologist @kick_my_rick oh haha you're right. I usually associate obgyn's with pregnancies but they do the dirty work too haha. Yeah that's weird #ew @kelsimus_prime sports and fat people are the only things that make you cry Clay Matthews sacked Joe Webb by rolling on the ground. I mean whatever gets the job done I guess Back in btown. @baileySAMuelson and I have now been to parts of campus I didn't even know existed This semester is going to be so boring without @joegilham10 in any of my classes #zzzzz "Anybody that knows me knows that I have a fear of mayonnaise." @baileySAMuelson @kelsimus_prime Sooo... when's spring break again? Space Jam on the hoosier cinema channel #hellyeah I never understand when I can't find something in my room. It's a dorm room, there's only so many places it can be... Sometimes you miss the memories, not the person Jake from Sixteen Candles is perfect. Where can I get one? Not a good enough reason to use the word 'penetrate' @AliCharles124 @kick_my_rick you're both in finite right? Would either of you want my notes from last semester? If not I'm tossing them haha @AliCharles124 @kick_my_rick Kristin has them so you guys can share them and do what you want with them! "OMG Jenn. It's Jeff Howard. Don't freak out..." - @boyd_scout hahahahaha @leeannasue are you ok??? I can think of a million things I'd rather do than sit through stats. Like rhythmic gymnastics... or heroin @DDo311 where is the meeting at? Is a nice christian boy too much to ask for? #apparently @emilyygarmann amen to that #smartass @__SwaggDaddy__ http://t.co/51sEZJKQ It bothers me when people say that they don't believe God exists but then blame Him for anything bad that happens to them "I hope my son's as hot as he is someday." - @baileySAMuelson referring to Chad Michael Murray @kdremonas I'd buy your album There was probably a record high of white girls that downloaded the song No Diggity because they watched Pitch Perfect Finally got to hang out with @zSwEiN62 again! Missed that kid @zSwEiN62 aw I'm sorry!! I'm glad you came though "@CourtneyK_21: Shout out to @JennyJellyBeann for being the best roommate ever. Love you!! #roomielove" I gotchu girl :) love you too! The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. - Psalm 34:18 I'm excited that I'm officially going to Guatemala this summer, but I'm sad that I'll miss Colombia this year You're in college and you drink alcohol? How original. Please tweet about it again next weekend. I've been a little extra feisty lately, I apologize. I have a girl crush on Jennifer Lawrence. MARK WAHLBERG ???????????????????????? Sorry Jennifer Lawrence. #IGotAThingFor http://t.co/JhvHtTBM Someone may be praying for the things that you take for granted I've been listening to nothing but @Timeflies for the past 3 days @lkmcginness I want to go Feb 15 when they're in Chicago!! Nothing sucks more than when someone makes you feel like you're not good enough anymore. I could go for some chocolate ice cream with m&amp;m's right now. #EmotionalEaterProbs The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still. - Exodus 14:14 Tonight's the season premiere of Workaholics AND Mark Wahlberg is on the Tonight Show. If that's not enough to have a good day idk what is. Stats class ???????????? I just creeped on @KelsiMorris22 so hard. I'm really sorry haha I miss @NateBruggeman's #cole tweets For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. - 1 Corinthians 1:25 All of the attractive guys at IU are at the union at precisely 10:48am on Tuesdays and Thursdays. @zSwEiN62 haha so do you agree then? @kelsimus_prime they get together and compare stats, like how many girls made a pass at them that week or how many girl's numbers they got Seems like all the friends I lose touch with become talented and famous Military Man Parade Thursday &lt;3 This is why people don't want to be friends with us @kelsimus_prime @baileySAMuelson @boyd_scout @CourtneyK_21 I'm a little biased, but I'm pretty confident that I have the best friends anyone could ask for. That guy putting his hands on my hips was just as creepy as that one time some guy smelled my hair. I want Qdoba. "@kelsimus_prime: @boyd_scout @JennyJellyBeann you guys should have skipped class. We are watching high school musical!!" How fulfilling @kelsimus_prime all you have to do is sing about your feelings. #betonit You're being the Kevin of the Jonas Brothers right now. @kelsimus_prime @baileySAMuelson @boyd_scout @_MelisssaAnnn I'm listening to this right now and that's my favorite line haha Thanks so much for being there for me this week! @mnoonie93 @boyd_scout @shaylinrose @bonniemailey @Strom_Qui_Qui @kick_my_rick #loveyouall @kick_my_rick haha you said cry but I know you meant Cru ?????? I'm glad you're coming!! @kelsimus_prime PO-TA-TOES. How much would it cost to have @woodelijah as the ring bearer at my wedding someday? @NateBruggeman Cal from Timeflies ?????? It's almost THAT time of year... http://t.co/KVei1S62 Sometimes I wonder about how different my life would be if I had met different people or made different choices I enable @boyd_scout's bad eating habits. Nothing makes me angry like the Clean &amp; Clear and Smucker's commercials I just need space so I can heal. ? @BaileySAMuelson @boyd_scout cheaters!! @BaileySAMuelson @boyd_scout except you still lost. Can't mess me @kelsimus_prime and I @KelsiMorris22 it's so hard in Wright haha you have to have a pretty big group, but it's so awesome Nothing belittles you more than walking by Cody Zeller @cbalogna makes me feel like I'm a funny person. I like that @KelsiMorris22 glad I could help :) good luck tomorrow!! Happy birthday @meghanmarie28!! ?????????????????? When I'm walking to class I don't really pay much attention to anything so if you see me and I don't say hi, I'm not trying to be a bitch! At this point, I'll probably just be constantly cold until spring comes One of my favorite things about music is how a song can carry a memory. Even if its not significant u think of it every time that song plays @jessledyard ice storm ?????? I got an autographed All Time Low album booklet in the mail and my first instinct was to smell it. Why... I think about you all the time, but I don't need the same. It's lonely where you are I'm sorry for everyone who couldn't be at Assembly Hall the past 2 hours. That place was insane. #hoosierhysteria #iubb Cutest twitter pic goes to @_gocarol ? #FREENATE @baileySAMuelson @kelsimus_prime @NateBruggeman (or should I say Tate Bruggeman) I love how @CourtneyK_21 doesn't even react anymore when I randomly start laughing to myself about something I was walking back from class and this guy walking passed me looks at me real serious and goes, "I'm gonna remember you." ...for what? ?????? As soon as I start a health spree before spring break I get so many junk food cravings #pizza #cookies #icecream #wings #donuts #chocolate My twitter feed is getting ugly real fast. #IU #purdue Of course the fire alarm goes off when I'm in the shower... @KelsiMorris22 I'm pretty sure that if the building was up in flames, the sprinkling water from my shower wouldn't do much This isn't a jab at purdue or anything, but AJ Hammons might be the dullest light bulb of all the light bulbs I've ever met Will Sheehey's arms &gt;&gt;&gt; There are some people I only see when I'm eating and they probably think that's all I do. Which is kind of true. @cbalogna @cnosegoes06 Peter and Hanner didn't handle the birthing video too well today in class @meghanmarie28 @ChelseanLately hahah eww My parents never call me or answer when I call them. #LOVEME Cru is easily one of the highlights of my week every week @IUCRU @KelsiMorris22 I thought that was you but didn't know for sure! Honestly I don't know if I could have reached over anyway, I'm too short I was watching Buck Wild and then the cable went out. It's like it committed suicide cuz the show was so bad @_gocarol congrats that's awesome!! Atheist Dr Rosenburg's arguments for why God doesnt exist only affirm my beliefs that He does exist according to scripture, fact, experience South court for the biggest game of the year! #IUBB Ears are ringing, throat's burning. I love being a Hoosier! #IUBB

Me - "OMG I couldn't tell by your quarter zip, tights, riding boots, polo hat, and ponytail." I have decided to stop making fun of Greek life...jk I couldn't ever.

Really wish I was one of those people that knew exactly what they wanted to do with the rest of their life. It would give me way more motivation. But that's not the case, and a fear of failure has become a constant feeling. They say they there are people that are in their late twenties that still don't know what they want to do.. That freaks me out so bad. RT @LilWayne_YMCMB: Don’t change yourself so someone else will like you. Stay true &amp; you’ll find someone who likes you for you.

I have a question :):):) @Beezus_12 what's wrong Billy? I really miss the feeling of victory. I really loved the feeling of a runner on my back and knowing I would do everything in my power to beat them.

Really don'y know what to do about this right now #soconfused Glad I have such a busy week ahead of me to keep my mind occupied, hopefully it goes fast, I miss my family!!! Seriously I was sound asleep at 9, why am I still up! #ihatemysleepinghabits I really should be sleeping, but no, i'm about to finish Ellen's book, when did I buy it? About 6 hours ago....@TheEllenShow Dumb rumors make it really hard to try to change Listening to @HoodieAllen all day makes me so depressed that his Chicago concert falls on finals week, I'd do anything to be there #obsessed @Anna_Denning It's down to just me Lisa left but yeah I want to go out with you tonight, it depends on my family. If not, tomorrow for sure! Such a fun night with my little sister, missed her so much?????? #thatawkwardmoment when you're face to face 2 feet away from your sister, say Hi. And she doesn't see you.... @lydia_frei @HannahFink13 2 Minutes Its one thing to hear Drops of Jupiter. But it's a whole other story to have someone play it and sing it to you &gt;&gt;@HannahFink13 @GusRehring @TLKrouse weak Sooooo annoyed. #everytime @DJ_GrossryStore is my hero ?????? Never want to use the first bathroom again because of @Tylerochs22 last night Soooo mad at @GusRehring and @HannahFink13 for doing this to me when I have to stay in alone :( Colts game with the family ???????????? @CourtneyHeddens @dammit_dale hahahahaha such a funny night that was pretty much everyone. Missed talking to @mr_efff_it #themaplekindyeah @Tylerochs22 @hannahfink13 oh yeah I didn't even think to look in my room......... No I hate myself for waiting in line for Burger King for this long #fatass #thatawkwardmoment when someones facebook status makes you cry in the middle of Wells Library #didntexpectthatone "Brb I'm going to look in the car for my card" @HannahFink13 3 hours later...... Still not back #itsnotthatbigofcar @bitesized_xo hahahahah whoops. Thats hilarious i love you! Already want summer! I miss the sun and lake and @taddorton even though he's a jerk now :( ???????? One more class then the weekend!!! I can do this. Guys who play an instrument &gt;&gt;&gt; ???????????? "Tonight your memory burns like a fire, With every word it grows higher and higher" Tell me why i'm up right now, arguing about evolution/religion??? Thinking of @lydia_frei @klsatarino and everyone at #IUDM Keep it up! I wish I could give you all this unnecessary energy I have right now. Loving all these random Halloween costumes on the floor can't wait for more this weekend Soooo sick of everyone being so needy and stubborn Funny when people's low key comments are completely obvious Whyyyy does my face constantly turn bright red when I'm not even embarrassed #isuck ?????? Probably the most frustrating night of my life Such a life changing week and weekend, theres no explanation for things like this you are in my prayers #RIPAmelia Sooooo why do you desperately hang all over people you apparently hate? @BrianB5844 hahaha its just getting to far bitches be crayy y000000 #hoes @GusRehring Wow, Taylor Swift has my life spot on right now... like always #SadBeautifulTragic This is so interesting watching people be taught English, they just can't get it "How long worked have you there been?" When every crush you've ever had calls your best friend hot &lt;&lt;&lt; #k @HannahFink13 #itstruethough @HannahFink13 haha just think of someone I've liked and they've said it @i_stay_golden @hannahfink13 hahaha I always do Indiana killing it #ilovemyschool ?????? DMWMP Patrick how many times do we have to tell you, we're Spongbobs parents not yours... What I'm an orphan!! #Classic ND football and IU basketball, both number one, both undefeated #perfect ?????????????????? It's annoying when people bring up and try to argue with football scores during a basketball game, uhhh they're different sports. Half of my heart's got a real good imagination, Half of my heart's got you #np best ever. @cbogey89 are you serious i got mine out the second i bought it how are you not dying I don't know how people can find any song by Alvin and the Chipmunks enjoyable. 'If watching is all you're ever going to do, then you're going to watch your life go by without you' Hate when we're watching a movie or video and someone says "watch this"..... I am This wait is actually killing me. Seriously, next person who knocks on my door don't expect me to get up, no ones ever there. It's scary how much one night can change your entire life. Such a fun night last night! Now I have to study until I can't stay up any longer Happy Birthday @mr_efff_it you've gained a few points on our tally chart though............. @mr_efff_it hahahahahah best plan ever @Anna_Denning hahahaha I literally just did that exact same thing Don't even try tonight....... but really, you suck. Idc if we're always together you still can't just take my stuff and think its okay. liars &lt; Hate that my dumb phone wont lock, seriously when did I tweet eight times to The Ellen Show? @thesir_Charles "I literally don't sleep anymore hah", I was thinking the same thing....and I have a psych final in 5 hours. It's just way to late to try So happy to be home for a few weeks, theres so many people I can't wait to see. I want to be close to a soldier just so I can eventually take part in a surprise home coming. I'm actually in tears watching these videos. #thatawkwardmoment when I cut through behind Dwenger and it's a passing period #hikids ????????????? Hope I can follow thru with this. Omg ew who's watching Ellen, that wasn't real right? If it wasn't for that one night everything would be different, and we would be fine. Someone play me in Ruzzle ....... Jfreistr Best news ever tonight! After tomorrow, I can't wait to go back to Bloomington. Watching Die Hard, such a Christmas classic. ?????????????????? @haley_henline hahah yeah @dammit_dale Come sit in my section!! I work every night. @dammit_dale haha Yeah I serve i'll give you gift cards, the one on Dupont. @dammit_dale just tell me when! Such a fun day with the family at Pokagon I had so much fun seeing everyone over break, Can't believe I'm already going back to Bloomington tomorrow! @Codi_Henline You should have gone sledding!! I told you to. @Codi_Henline there you go Come back to IU! I need you guys, @HannahFink13 @CourtneyHeddens @GusRehring @RollinandBowlin ???????????? #thatawkwardmoment when you realize you don't follow your best friend, seriously since when did that happen... Sorry @HannahFink13 @HannahFink13 hahaha I knowwwww I used to. That awful "I have a question" text &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ?????? Oh yeah we have school tomorrow...... I can't even believe that we've already finished one semester of college. These four years are going to fly by! #liveitup Seriously hardest decision i've ever had to make! I hope it was the right one. I will never go work out with a guy, it freaks me out when I see couples all lovey-dovey at the gym spotting each other #nottheplace @zhafft hahahah yeah thanks. Cant make it AGAIN to any of the @HoodieAllen concerts. Come to IU for Little 500!!!! Wow a whole $7.50 back for a book I spent $40.00 on... thanks IU. That halftime show is awesome to bad @ChiquitaJohanna and @Anna_Denning want to be the last ones in Assembly Hall Every song by @HoodieAllen puts me in the best mood, my life would be made if I ever met him. #eightteencool #songforanactress @thesir_Charles I want to so bad! But his only concert close to Fort Wayne I have a test, just like the last tour. I'm quite possibly the least photogenic person I've ever known. #kindaembarrassing ?????????????????? @bitesized_xo haha noooo there's some bad ones floating around @bitesized_xo oh stop.... @bitesized_xo hahahaha whatever come to IU! @HannahFink13 she ded New snap chat, find me jfreistr!!! Such a fun week and weekend, so glad I got to see @Mike_n_Ike28 This Harry Potter conversation is getting way to intense? @HannahFink13 ?????? I hate arguing with people who don't even stick to the same case Being nice to a girl doesn't obligate her to be interested in you. Don't pull the "nice guys finish last" card. @HannahFink13 Whyyyy do we never think to look and see if it's raining before we walk outside. I'm freezing. ???????

I'm reform and that's not a Reform practice. Therefore, it didn't happen to me. My fingertips, and my lips, they burn from the cigarettes. Frank Ocean flow. I believe the subtle, well-dressed swag is the best. I think The Game's new album is going to be pretty live. RT “@varunbganapathy: Victoria Secret Fashion Show with @JohnniMoxx #ICanStillDream” “@varunbganapathy: #ShitJonSays "I wont settle for anything less than a Victoria Secret Model." #SpokenLikeATrueMan” IT'S GONNA HAPPEN!

"I'm not going to be the person I'm expected to be anymore." @varunbganapathy @xuaflyrehc Anything but Justin Bieber's picture. @_ObeyMyFRESH_ Yeah what's up? @_ObeyMyFRESH_ online. Knowledge isn't to be gained and kept, but to be passed. It's too early for a college student to go to sleep (even though my eyes hurt from how tired I am right now). I still mess with Lazé 100%--- @_DJPM check out the new background! Instrumental to Look What You've Done is so chill... The verse I just wrote to "Look What You've Done" &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; @Get_It_Cody I didn't record it yet. I got a real mic and it's at home so on waiting til break! Rap songs with a substance are the best to me. @_DJPM on my page bro! Hate when I have a typo! @Vito_TheBoss That's too deep for me to listen to! Sandwich with too much bread. The worst. @tear_bear1101 @BigSean_Boi25 @jacknovak003 @Young_Kev5 @JacksonHelton1 @CraigKaiser10 You guys are weak. @tear_bear1101 you got it?

The road to Franklin makes me think of "roller coaster road" by my grandparents house #weeeee Dear Franklin College and it's student population, I miss you already. ???????????? I challenge you to name a song about tractors that doesn't make you happy... @colson_420 well dubstep makes me angry so we'll have to agree to disagree haha. @lucyphares you're right haha...my grandpa wouldn't want me to like that one. @HalexHale don't forget alien insemination @HalexHale it's more complicated than that! I'm not even sure what actually happened! You sounded like you knew that by now I'm sorrrrry! It's true, God gave me you Another porn star followed me after my last tweet. It had "God" in it.

Finished the pizza. #noshame “@rileylayne: For real need people to play nintendogs with me tho...” That's my game dude. Boys and Girls Club conversations: "What's your name?" "Theo...son of MISCHIEF!" Okay then... B&amp;G club conversations part two: "You've worn a batman shirt every day this week!" "Yeah, it's new! And my moms pregnant!" I would just like to thank @SandCassle for retweeting the @emrgencykittens account and enlightening me to its existence. Thanks Sandra. @ashleybluecolts missing you two. I'm seeing pool dates in my crystal ball. Now just to find the warm weather... @ashleybluecolts whoops too* as in "I'm TOO lazy to delete and retype that tweet" I want an Irish wolfhound so it can jump up and give me people hugs http://t.co/UTk8koNo @rileylayne crush me with its love...

"I like James Franco's younger brother, Frankie." "Frankie Franco...?" Hahaha @snozzzzberries @mckinseymoore only if I can wear a tux Why is Brian Pruett posting pictures with this girl.

Thank you and goodnight. @abster_brown make it speedy brown Camo overalls are clearly a symbol of wealth #DuckDynasty To the girl that stole my brand new shirt out of the laundry room: I hope you look horrible in it and karma has it's way with you. @Saucy_Seth dang it...it'll probably look better on you! @mckinseymoore THENNNNN you should text me back Numb is the new deep Hahahaha, okay then #sorrynotsorry I think I'm developing a bed sore from laying here all night. Jennifer Lawrence you are my favorite. I. Want. Red. Lobster. Biscuits. NOW. Cole Sprouse has an Instagram account dedicated to taking pictures of people taking pictures of him. His captions are hilarious. I'm dead. In need of an emergency red velvet cupcake. Mission accomplished ?????? http://t.co/1nmD8OvB @ashleybluecolts don't tease me @mck_mcc was that a cry of jealousy or warning? @mck_mcc I don't remember reading your tweet but I must have gotten some type of subliminal message from it haha. I SWEAR I just heard Luna trill in my dorm room...separation anxiety-induced hallucination? I call pity rose ?????? #notafan @erinhaysxo but I don't have an ovennnn ?????? #dormlifeproblems @mckinseymoore no you do not, it's what I'm here for. @HalexHale you're so deep I can't even see you anymore #emokid #tearsofblood I will check my email until my 8 am is cancelled. Which is a long shot because Bridget is serious about her Roman culture. Oh well. @HalexHale hoping it's cancelled isn't lazy! Not going is lazy. You're mad about my witty, Halex-esque response to your last tweet haha. My eyelids deserve a weight lifting award for that last class ?????? Long fingers and baby thumbs means ill fitting gloves for Codi #itsacurse "Does your mom make you pick up before your cleaning lady comes too?!" #richkidproblems @abster_brown @chiliconcarneol Solve any crime by dinner time ???????????? @mckinseymoore I just teared up haha. I love you so so so much! Can't wait to see you this weekend! I just want a pet lion. It's really not that much to ask. I just got caught snap chatting in public #redhanded #noshame #dontpointatme @abster_brown and I could hear the music from your beats ten feet away. The words and everything. Your poor ears. PS: that song is ancient Mint chocolate cliff bars are my new favorite ?????? @slussherr YES. Perfection. Oh Miranda Lambert, you're so sassy ?????? @dkammerer12 is nineteen! ???????????????????????? It's just a little extra stomach to keep me warm for winter, not the freshman fifteen. Yeah, let's go with that. Tonight is the Relay for Life kickoff at Indulge in Fortville. Go any time 6:30-8:30 and get your team captain kit! Let's reach our goal of 22 teams and fight for the dream that one day no one will have to hear the words "you have cancer" @kodenamekayla sorry to say that I won't be there! Haha, I'm at IU so I can't make it. @HalexHale hahahahaha. How do you respond to that? @HalexHale dang Halex you really are the best at out-halexing people on twitter It was all fun and games until Giovanna Plowman called my girl @GloZell a monkey...that's not okay I'm honestly tempted to get my car and leave right now, I just want to be home @mgephart11 I need to find a weekend in February or early march that I can make the haul ?????? @jessdav16 @foreverhoosiers @abster_brown @snozzzzberries I'm sorry if I'm not supposed to think it's so funny hahahaha @snidersk I will! Love you too! You know what, no. Whiney tweet deleted. It's a happy day guys ? Hey @HalexHale, can we start #sandlerquotesaturday? I'd have a lot more to offer. @HalexHale SCORE Wood just told me he met Hobo Jack that was on American Pickers over the summer #jealous Luna found and played with (but didn't quite kill) her first mouse #historicmoment @HalexHale hey now, this is my sweet indoor cat, she's not our mouse killer. I guess that tweet was kind of an honor roll bumper sticker... "Sooooo hot, want to touch the hiney ahoooo" #sandlerquotesaturday Incase anyone cares...Luna killed the mouse. I didn't think she had it in her. Here's his last live photo #RIP http://t.co/r2UyQYQ5 Home is wherever I'm with you ? I think my life would be better if I didn't have sinuses ?????? Please don't get technical with me about what this would do, let me whine If I send you ugly pictures of myself via text message rather than snapchat, then you know it's real. I hope Tierra falls down the stairs again tonight #bachelor @mckinseymoore only the best ?????? Every time my psych professor mentions Obama its just a ploy to keep us from discovering that he IS Obama. I'm on to him. SO. CLUTCH. @abster_brown She said "Tierrable" ?????? Count your blessings, not your burdens First I called Neveah Haven, then I called Moses Noah. I'm just having trouble keeping these religious names all these kids have straight. I helped make a bunch of hot glue gun pillows at the club today and my inner 4Her made me burn my fingers for not properly sewing. But she's sweepy @HalexHale http://t.co/1wn74Lcf A right will take you to the interstate, but a left will bring you right back here to me Tornado watches become a lot scarier when you live on the tenth floor of a building ?????? Momma once told me, "you're already home where you feel loved." I get lost in my mind, I am lost in my mind. Dear world: ?????? I'm sorry to say that's a punching fist and not a fist bumping fist @HalexHale I just said it wasn't a fist bumping fist...cool your jets Mr. Airman. @WileyLodde http://t.co/pRGktbk6 @WileyLodde never! TERRKIN BERT THE HER-HER-JERS ???????? I should have lived in Collins. Such a huge mistake. Astronauts...blah, blah, blah. WE WROTE THE FRIGGIN HUNGER GAMES. PS...I realize space travel is a bigger feat, don't hurt me Practice at Purdue http://t.co/nN73SH6x Woke up, got dressed, and speed walked to Ballantine (sorry @snozzzzberries) and my 8 AM was cancelled. Mixed emotions ???????????????????????? And that is why I need to check my email in the morning...even though she sent it less than an hour before class @mgephart11 ?????? @mckinseymoore offended that I was last.... As I was nodding off last night I had one of those pre-sleep half dreams in which I was pregnant with kittens. Normal? @DrunkCatLadies @snozzzzberries I mean it was my second one...no biggie or anything hahaha. She favorited this one too, so now you're famous! Mom took nap time pictures of me and Luna Tuna #mybaby http://t.co/VigdrA5C Just ready for this game ??????????????????? #HoosierNation Family trip to goodwill and a new Polaroid camera ?holla. @Coachsteeno new to me! I would sell an organ to be in Assembly right now. @rsnider23 I don't want to talk about it You're dealt the hand you're dealt but you choose how you play it I CALLED IT I was so ready for the club to be jumpin jumpin...?????? “@ShitNobodySays: I miss all of the good rappers, like Ja Rule.” @SawyerSorrell “@LauurJames: If only that Dodge commercial was a Ford commercial.” Reading my mind Oh baseball, how I hate to love you. My favorite sport that takes away my favorite person. I hope the gym is fairly empty, I've got a date with a stair master and I'd like to have some privacy for romance and stuff.

Non-stop nose whistling...can't even handle it @LaurenSmileyyy Ahahaha I also slacked on a paper. I should've skipped! MISS YOU TOO. This blaring Christmas music HAS to be a joke. I'm trying to do homework. Bedtime. Dreamworld. Goodnight. @dave___anderson Congratulations, Dave!

Do you like violence? @slarkin4 Hahaha hell yeah! Omg they have squash at Gresh. YES. @LaurenSmileyyy Ahhahaha I'm sorry. If you're a sophOmore in college, you probably should not be misspelling your Facebook album as "Sophmore Year." Just a thought. Disappointed with Eminem's recent collaboration in Skylar Grey's newest song. She should've just stuck with "I Need A Doctor" and been done. @phe_beD I cherish and look forward to them @TayeDuff Hahahaha awww @CoreyCockrum We have a new girl?? Considering all of the atrocities that have gone down on Jenk 1, it is a blessing to walk into a clean bathroom stall. Can't believe I'd forgotten how incredibly attractive Spencer Reid is. @miacatherineee Good ole Roach clip @miacatherineee Das right. But that's what everyone calls him. Hop off :* I love @AustinWilliamHo...a lot My last class for this semester :( AND my last class with @LaurenSmileyyy :( :( The fact that the best I can do in Psych is an 83% makes me want to die. @AustinWilliamHo I don't remember that.

Ill let you know when I work. @Rizzmyster Spell it right... -_- Thought about actually getting up and exercising this week but at the rate I'm going, I'll be lucky to get out of bed tomorrow.

YOu are gorgeous! ;) @BritBrummett Friday. And I'm making it my goal to hang out with all of you at some point. Hello, Insomnia.

Lol. @RawrItzRachel damn. Lol @RawrItzRachel yeah tell me about it. -_- Thanks group members. Our PowerPoint looks like shit. I'm done with my last paper for the semester! It's pretty damn good, if I do say so myself. #tootingmyhorn Yay waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back asleep. #merp It's lonely being up this early.

No sleep for Kate. Again. I can hear people down the hall coughing. #damn My priest told me to pray every time someone annoyed me... Lately, I've been praying ALL day. I wish people would cover their mouths when they cough... I'm NOT getting sick again 2 days before I'm home. What am I doing on my day off from finals? Studying for tomorrow's finals? No, laying in bed, watching Pocahontas. Way to make me feel like crap just for trying to help. If I have another dream where my teeth fall out tonight, I am never sleeping again... And I'm going to go to the dentist just to make sure. @AlexxThaGr8 it was by far the worst dream I've ever had. I'm so scared that I'm gonna have another one like it. Lol @AlexxThaGr8 Yeah, when I woke up, I had to go check my teeth in the mirror to make sure I wasn't missing any. I'm sick of trying so hard and doing everything wrong. I guess you can go the whole day without talking to me... Thanks. 14 hours until I'm home!!! I'm hot without my fan on... But I'm cold with my fan on. #firstworldproblems My hardest final is tomorrow and my eyes choose tonight to be light sensitive. Sleep is detrimental to someone doing well on an exam... Especially math. Need at least 7 hours. #justsaying LAST FINAL!!! How the hell can you kill 18 children? Stop talking about gun control and just pray. Shit insomnia is back. Looks like I could be pulling an all- nighter. Luke won family bingo... http://t.co/kzG3dCIb Dropped my phone in the toilet and now the flashlight won't turn off.

THERE'S AN EVIL PRESENCE IN MY HOUSE. I can't go to sleep now... The covers won't save me... I really need to stop watching scary movies. Looks like I'll have to go to Christmas at the zoo next year. :(( The kiss at the end of romantic comedies &gt;&gt;&gt; ?????? #aww #hopelessromantic Excited for low key New Year's Eve with my family. #lovethem Why do I want to just scream at the top of my lungs right now? #weirdbuttrue You don't even act like you want to see me...

I'm going through withdrawals. #fav #love If God brings you to it, then He will bring you through it. This sinus issue that's going on needs to just go away.

Merp. #lovebreak Go** don't feel like spelling at 1 in the morning. #slightlytired Just goes to show you can only trust certain people with personal things. @LoIsFoSho #loveyougirl There are so many books I want to read but no money to get them. #damnit #sucks All of the leaves on all of the trees are falling with me down to the ground. Can't wait to go sledding with Tyler. Who's willing to bet on me breaking my arm or something? #shouldbeinteresting Just posted a photo http://t.co/7H1nHquj My twitter is in following people. #weirdbuttrue #sorrynotsorry Never give Tyler sweet tea because he will get hyper af. #hilarious This anxiety medicine is awesome... I'm not even getting the slightest bit anxious over subtweets directed at me. #lovely #feelsomuchbetter That hot chocolate we had after sledding was AMAZING. #wantsomemore I'm not even gonna be coherent at this stupid work meeting. #whatsthepoint #tootired You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs. My baby brother showed me all the race cars he got for his friends birthday. #cutestthing I slept amazing last night. First time in a while that's happened. My baby brother has mastered the art of antagonizing his siblings. #keepsmessingwithme I'm pretty sure I was the one that gave everyone in my house a cold. #sorry #mybad My bubby :))) http://t.co/3VeODDQL My dad always hums to songs... Even if he doesn't know them. And after we see movies, he has to quote the whole movie on the way home. We all saw the movie! No need to quote it bro. Still haven't packed anything for school and I leave tomorrow... It's strange how you can go from loving someone to hating them in a few short days. Passive aggressive much? Gosh it's going to be a pain in the butt trying to get all my crap back in my dorm... B-town bound. Stepdad is reading us weird facts on the drive out to IU. Oh what a shame that you came here with someone. ?????? Can I just go back to bed? I can already tell that my Mondays are gonna suck. #shitty First time I've slept 12+ hours in a long frickin time. #feelsomuchbetter How to be a dick during a lecture class? Sit on the outside of the row so people have to climb over you to get a seat. Shit, my butt hurts from sitting in this uncomfortable seat for an hour. #isclassoveryet This class is soooooo long. Idk if I can do this all semester. There are a couple cute boys though. #heyimkate Art class: 3 hours in class... And expected 15 hours outside of class. #dropping #toomuch I hope these changes to my schedule are better than what I had before. #wewillsee #fingerscrossed My hair is behaving horribly today. #juststaystraight I really want to put my hair up but I forgot my hair tie in my room. #crap So I guess I'm not gonna eat lunch today. #starving #stupidclass Biology discussion was full of awkward people listening to an awkward graduate student teaching this pointless class. #wtf New shipments into the C-store? Time to stock up on Easy Mac and Cocoa Krispies. #FoodAddict I am genuinely happy right now. Haven't felt this good in a long time. #lovingit #hopeitstays Finally making some friends here. #abouttime I'll apologize when you realize how much of a dick you were to me and apologize first. I want everything back to normal as much as the next person but now I know that you look down on me as a person. #intolerable Learning about babies in psychology and all I can think about is my baby brother. #imisshim Out of all the seats in this room... You chose the one right next to me. #awkward Heard the most ignorant comment I've ever heard about Deaf people today. Made me want to smack the guy that said it. I really, really, really dislike you right now. I don't need people who are gonna judge me based on my family. I love my family and I'm done letting you walk all over me. #soswerve Now that I got my bad mood rant out of the way, today can be a good day. #bringit I'm not going to let you ruin my day. @joylaflo68 oh I will. Wtf @leviburke http://t.co/1WGTTLoc Devil dog... http://t.co/hutMIfyI Family movie time :)) @Laughlin_outlwd @5_GCC @joylaflo68 After today, I don't think I'll ever feel warmth again. #shivering #socold Found an apartment and roommates. Now I can focus on my classes instead of stressing out over what I'm gonna do next year. #excited :)) How is it that even though I slept all day today... right when I step into a class, I start yawning incessantly? #icantbetired I do not like not having my mom here when I feel like this. Still feel like death. #flu #stupid If I could just start feeling remotely better please. It's only a matter of time before I've gotten the whole floor sick with the flu. #imsosorryguys Ugh can only stand up for 2 minute intervals. #stupidflu Just had a meltdown after talking to my dad on the phone. Just want to be home. #hatebeingsick I'm 19 years old and still cry for my mommy when I'm sick. #suchababy Pitch perfect &gt;&gt;&gt; There's 2 reasons why I watch pitch perfect so much... Fat Amy is hilarious... And Jesse is my future husband. #love Woke up to the exact spot on A Cinderella Story that I fell asleep to last night. Thank you Abc family. Damn this cough is killing me. “@SnapchatLife: That one asshole that screenshots your ugly snapchat selfies &lt;&lt;&lt;” @LoIsFoSho -_- Lots of thanks goes out to @leviburke7 for bringing me a slushie when I was home alone after being all sickly. #goodfriend My grandma is astonished that you actually have to have an iTunes account to use your iPhone... #goodlord -_- Grandpa: "I love you, Donna." Grandma: "Oh, you're an asshole, Joe." My grandparents everyone. Loved the bonding time I had with my best friend! @LoIsFoSho Should I get a head start on my reading for sociology or just go to bed? #fuckit #sleepwins Ugh the static is more annoying than the cold right now. #stupidhair Sheehey is adorbs ?????? Fantastic seats at the game. Got to see Zeller and Sheehey up close and personal. ?????? http://t.co/0RrpFCPQ My grandma is better than yours. She sends me "Get Well" cards when I'm sick. #loveher http://t.co/r6ts6twO My card from my grandma plus getting the last jar of Nutella from the c-store has made it a fantastic day. Cute guy from class waves to me in the hallway &gt;&gt;&gt; #mademyday When the prof is going super fast, all handwriting skills go out the window. #chickenscratch I wish we were allowed to have pets in the dorms. I just miss my dogs way too much. ?????? So I want my tan back... When's summer? Super excited for my committee. #MR2013 @HoosierKate16 All I want right now is McDonalds. If someone would just get me Easy A on DVD so I can stop renting it, please. #greatlyappreciated When other people are sleeping, the polite thing to do is go out of the room to talk on the phone. #impolite #idontdothattoyou Couldn't be more excited for my new roommates for next year. #cantwait No one plays back on ruzzle so I have to keep requesting new opponents. #grrrr I just don't want to even get up right now. So I don't mind the rain as long as it stays this warm. A moment of love, a dream, a laugh #bestsongever My grandma, my dad, and my brother should NOT have phones because they NEVER answer them. #seriously There are never enough pink starbursts in the package. #myfavorite I'm sorry to be mean but this TA is stupid. Cocoa Krispies for dinner... guys, my addiction has gotten a bit out of hand. Now just to remember all the names that I learned tonight. #brainisfried “@LoIsFoSho: @kateydilla75 Lol ily http://t.co/L3MmYhUQ” I hate you ??????

My first class tomorrow just needs to be cancelled due to lack of sleep. Today's going to be brutal. Fighting sleep all day. #sleepdeprived Peanut butter and jelly Wednesdays... #yay? #needrealfood And coffee... God forbid I forget coffee on a day like this. You can cry about it or you can dance about it. #kidpresident #peptalk Professor Monotone is putting me to sleep. One more class and I could possibly squeeze a nap in before I start this paper. #icandoit Had to force my umbrella shut... Needless to say, I need a new umbrella now. Walking home in the rain! #woohoo @Dan_Arndt Good way to look at it. #optimism Thanks for putting my snapchats on Instagram Levi... I will get you back. #paybacksabitch You know we're related because we have matching jars of Nutella. @sydney_harmon I HAVE to get up and do laundry tomorrow morning. No laying around all day. #goalset #boilerdown by 30. Sucks to suck. This is why @LoIsFoSho is my best friend. http://t.co/8QTIiV6E I know I said that I needed to do laundry this morning but getting out of bed is creating a bit of a struggle. #stilltired I nominate @IUBloomington for a Shorty Award in #bncollege because our largest organization @IUDM raised $2.1 MILLION in 2012 for sick kids!

Opposite of punk/grunge he is Time to go bend this final over #haveitmyway @crystalMETHridg that's what I was thinking.. Don't think McCartney wrote any other song like that. Hardly grunge, barely heavy, not worthy 5 down one to go, finna chill eat dinner then back to #thegrind @crystalMETHridg which is why him performing with a grunge band aka Nirvana is absurd #seemypoint?

I know I'm constantly make fun of Asians especially on twitter, but I'm more honest than ever when I say one next to me is FREAKING ME OUT Making heavy breathing sounds, reorganizing his papers, and he is currently at his standing to study.. Talk about #testanxiety @DuleyNoted1 they commit suicide by jumping off the nearest fortune cookie Chinese restaurant Favorite Christmas song - Santa baby by eartha kitt.

Go back to bed you crazy kid. Just to be clear: I'd rather be sleeping than tweeting about sleeping habbits but it doesn't work that way. I am gonna stop tweeting now though... Just casually going wherever the wind blows me. Unfortunately I'm serious.

It is currently 35 degrees outside. #wtf #waytoocold #gottahaveit I went and voted early today. First time ever voting! #election2012 #VOTE I love when scooters don't know how to park and block motorcycle spots. At least they are light enough for me to move them out of the way. There was so much frost on my motorcycle this morning I could have made a snow cone out of what I scraped off. #waytoocold I don't know how, but Rosie managed to make my first cup of coffee this morning taste like buttered popcorn.... This Friday isn't going well for me! My first try at drafting Selesnya. #MTGFNM Not only was my birthday this past Sunday, but I passed the #milestone of having ridden over 2000 miles on my #motorcycle! I will admit it: I went and saw #BreakingDawnPart2 (although someone else paid so I don't feel bad). That twist was really good. Best part. They put up really beautiful lights downtown. It made at least part of my really cold ride enjoyable. @the_Wonderland_ Oh no Megan what happened? :( @the_Wonderland_ Everyone has their moments of doubt. Keep your head up and remember that I will always be your biggest fan! @the_Wonderland_ Either way, something is burning. You should get your smoke detectors checked. I'm closing the gap of cruiser/crotch rocket relations one awkward, fringed leather jacket wearing guy at a time. Guess it is a good thing I couldn't sleep this morning - Rosie's alarm never went off. Gave her a foggy ride to work. #whyamiawakerightnow Sitting here at Subway waiting for the broccoli soup taken from the fridge to warm up. 'Garden fresh'? #yearight Just started #darksouls. Having a ton of fun screaming WTF IS THAT while running away from things. Another fun night of #MTGFNM! My Rakdos deck worked well for me and I got a very close second place. Rang in the new year with milk, cookies, and a good book. Hoping the rest of 2013 lives up to the first few hours. @the_Wonderland_ Get it girl! #MTGGTC "When you fight one #Gruul, you fight all #Gruul!" Stampeding through the tournament! I hope the strange noises from upstairs are from a vacuum and not a sacrificial bull slowly bleeding out on the carpet. #apartmentlife

He said, "I'm too drunk.. to taste this chicken." should probably go get my car now work, work, work. work has been the only negative aspect of my whole break, and that's not even bad because i'm not broke anymore. Look out for Cheddar Bob's new mixtape, Cheesier Than Wisconsin, dropping this summer @stav_z lolllll new years' resolutions are dumb. you should always try to be healthy, feel good, and make the most out of life. #'s on a calendar mean shit oh wow ray lewis be retiring after this season. let me reiterate. this amp is tight as fuuuuuuh @Fig_Newton23 i completely forgot about our matching cheek scars! lol Dj byrd went to jail once. what's good, munsterites? maybe i should start waving every IU win in purdue fans' faces. then again, my arm might get tired. but i'm satisfied enough with the thought of purdue losing to a team that lost 38-90 today. *cougheasternmichigancough* @mattkrueger9 lol nice subtweet brah. @mattkrueger9 EASTERN MICHIGAN/ BUCKNELL THO @mattkrueger9 i don't know how to type. @mattkrueger9 i mean i'd try to google how many championship banners purdue has, but i'm not so sure anything would come up @mattkrueger9 nah it's more like "the only argument i need" trick. with your logic, i guess you'd say lebron is better than MJ was, huh? @mattkrueger9 nah i'd rather just enjoy the two more wins over purdue this season. didn't know there was such a thing as a sore winner until today. #class #salty @mattkrueger9 the way i grew up, i wasn't big on sports in general until like the past 4/5 years, so i mean say whatever you want lol @mattkrueger9 #salty @mattkrueger9 childish is talking shit about IU unprovoked after a win. lol that's the only reason the argument even started. @mattkrueger9 oh you mean my tweet talking about how i should wave IU's wins in purdue fan's faces? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS DID! @mattkrueger9 you must not have gotten the point i was making, which was that it is exactly what purdue fans were doing tonight. dumbass. @mattkrueger9 by saying unprovoked i meant what fans like you did by retweeting IUHate after your win with seemingly no shit talk from IU @mattkrueger9 which was before my tweet even came about. @mattkrueger9 the only times i have RT'd shit talk about purdue were after the losses to bucknell and eastern michigan. not after an IU win @mattkrueger9 and my Byrd tweet from today was a harmless joke from when i saw that timeout (which was tight). it wasn't a shot at purdue. @mattkrueger9 okay truce lol @stav_z and by flexible, you mean tight. i know the language of the yolomar. i am ugly, and i'm proud! "Life ain't all about the money, well, it kinda is if you out of money" true statement. Gotta start training myself to go to bed before 12 and wake up around 8 for the next few days. damn Lol i looked like a tuwtle sophomore year of high school. damn. http://t.co/lbeTRAJa Minimum wage blows. i miss my $500-$600 paychecks from the summer :/ Not to mention the tip money that prevents me from dipping into my account.. Are you kidding me, taco bell drive thru? just call me Theresa McCulla when you're at the bottom, you can only go up and well, i'm at the bottom. time to climb. i cannot wait to see Rose's return to the UC. that crowd is going to erupt. horror movies just aren't what they used to be. not because i'm older, just because they make them with dumb plots nowadays. can't wait to start hitting the gym again back in B-Town @Celestial_Slime i meannn, 5th in the conference and 2nd in the division without derrick, not quite sure how you'd be shocked. @Celestial_Slime sure it might mess up the tempo at first, but after like 2 or 3 games back it won't be a problem. Jimmy Butler: "Dey told me to shoot some free trows, so i shot some free trows" @stav_z lol That's not how you eat marshmallows, lebron Lol jackass lebron missing that after the whistle dunk wish i could watch my favorite team in the west, but it's hookah time. at least i got to see a big bulls W there are three things i would like for this year's little 5. 1) rave. 2) a tight ass rock concert. 3) mac miller's return would be tight lol i love the fake wiz accounts that make him seem philosophical, when really all he thinks about is weed and money. packing sucks. so does leaving home. although i cannot wait to be back in bloomington. how is it that we go away for a month and the electric bill is the highest it's been all year. #fuckingpissed turned off all the lights and unplugged everything too... omar's buttcrack @Celestial_Slime http://t.co/djvh9yly I am in debt to way too many ppl. that's gotta change gonna start making some big changes soon. I was happy at the sight of this snow, but then thought, "shit, hope it doesn't pick up, i'm gonna be driving for 3 hours" Monster snowflakes now. not gonna be a fun ride back, i can already tell. So i get ready to finally mess around with my new amp, only to find out that i have either a faulty guitar cord or 2 faulty guitars. Cool.. Lol yup @stav_z but i used sam's drum set input cord to see if the guitar cord was the problem and it was. luckily it's only a $10 solution why is @sammyschles not up watching the colts lose to the ravens? @wsupwitChu lol nah, he's just bad at sleeping and waking up. @wsupwitChu yep, huge blackhawks fan. @wsupwitChu ohhhhhhhhh lol nope much, much closer to chicago than indianapolis. sorry haha king wizard need to get out of my funk. hookahhhh well... this got old quick. glad i have enough money to afford all my books... @sammyschles nope. still have to buy 3 books for comp that are over $50 each. one of them is $90 even YAYYY I'M FINALLY AN OFFICIAL SISTER!!

Have to be up and studying http://t.co/f8u7D9WD @chelsey_skeen still haven't decided which is worse tho studying or you always yelling at me. Jk of course I'm not missing tipsy Tuesday @chelsey_skeen not sure about the first part but damn straight to the second. That's If you don't leave early again like the last two times New phone background since I don't get to wear the gloves anymore but still showing support http://t.co/qCSDxJ3O Even the cool side of the pillow is uncomfortable right now #restless Sandusky's minimum sentence is 30 yrs and he cant get out early. That's pretty guaranteed life but not enough otherwise "Coffee is the lifeblood that fuels the dreams of champions" Ditka kicking &amp; screaming. Or the lifeblood of students cramming study sessions Time to go make this test my bitch What is this guy saying? What the hell is happening? Hahahahhahahgahshahgahahash @DStuts12 damn reflecting on my response wondering how it can be all part of the plan to have our future shots separated so often lately Weekends: I love college weekdays: this shit blows I've got no money, always have studying to do and on the loner status. #collegeisbipolar Independence is cool but things are also a lot harder to manage when no one is telling you how to handle it all Basically came to class to sign the attendance sheet #spacingout @Tripinupstairs @Fuad_Almighty what the hell happened to our government/Econ masterpieces? @Tripinupstairs @Fuad_Almighty rat bastard. my vote is they get copied and the original we take to Leonard thanksgiving or winter break @Tripinupstairs @fuad_almighty including the search along with them be copied and apart of them too of course @Fuad_Almighty @tripinupstairs something must be done with them so they receive the appreciation they deserve #qualityartwork Over half of this class is not here. Makes me wonder why I am Professor has been corrected by the class multiple times and is now stuttering every sentence. #stfu #smh This class is like APUSH all over again except with a crappy professor and its even more boring. Yeah highschoolers it can be worse Where you at Reds fans? Nothing to say for yourselves? Especially you cards haters This umps strike zone is all over the place That blows. But that's what game five is for. Who is still in Bloomington and doing something tonight? @ThatWhiteJew @hip_hipjorge woah bro. David Freeze was clutch the whole post season last year. @cigga_RELL0 you and cars don't get along First time sleeping at home since college. Forgot how comfortable my bed was Whose about to watch the cards kill it in game five? #12in12 What the fuck Adam Wainwright you are throwing bp right now #why My team &gt; your team with their last strike #cardinalsnation #12in12 What I learned from fall break is that I can't wait for thanksgiving break Tebow in on 3rd and 1 of course they are going to pass the ball... Oh wait. Predictable offense we still can't stop Andrew Luck played like a rookie today #baddecisions @Hannah_banaana you can just give me your ticket if it would make you feel better #bumdaymonday basketball shorts and hoodie I'm a big fan of the comic relief provided daily by the religious arguments that take place in front of Ballantine I hate looking up grades #stressful I hate professors who say an A is exceptional beyond requirement and a B is a good grade Bullshit meeting requirements should equate to an A iPhone 5 thumb commercial is dumb. My thumb does that on the 4 so either I got small thumbs or they got that one wrong Hate it when I am involuntarily a part of #TeamNoSleep Wish I could grow a full beard so I could stop having to shave every other day @cigga_RELL0 your the same way you're just to lazy and leave your half beard and fro Hats off to the dude in the Mario costume mocking the guy speaking by Ballantine #lolz Seriously tho you cannot find stand up comedy that will make you laugh harder than this dude @sNICKersbar12 shoulda seen him tell the girl she was going to hell. Had the whole crowd yelling at em #crazypreacherdude Well I now have a room all to myself @theeredbar0n Charlie decided to move back to California Tosh.O kills any remote possibility of productivity on a Tuesday Ever think of how strange life would be without music? #foodforthought Haha Calipari making excuses on ESPN just like after he lost in Bloomington. Also he is making an ass of himself Obama got Morgan Freeman to narrate one of his campaign commercials #wellplayed Relying heavily on my bullshitting talents to get me a good grade on this test Screw this class I just wanna do nothing but watch the cards right now A lot of people ask me if I like to argue. I tell em yeah actually I kinda do Decided watching the daily show and Colbert report is a far more entertaining way to follow this election than actually watching the debates Each time I try and figure out what I want to do with my life I end up with more possibilities than I started with Those people you see in college that look just like they did six years ago in middle school. someone throw some change see if it still works Much love to the cougar football guys even if things didn't turn out tonight still proud of them all especially the seniors #cougarfamily The man to miss more dunks for iu in history tom pritchard judging the dunk contest... Stuck on my mind now Randomness of college acquaintances and significance has pros &amp; cons. You meet lots of cool people but I'm not a fan of the lack of control Wouldn't it be cool if magic 8balls worked? In the last 48 hours I've slept for 3 but now I don't even feel close to being able to fall asleep #isthisreallife Not a fumble Wondering why it seems so different this time Cards just like to make things interesting. No more waste games after this one tho Threw a baseball for ten minutes earlier today and realized my football and baseball careers permanently destroyed my right arm. S/O to @THISisDJTK for blowing up the time line and giving me something entertaining to read #sleepingisforsquares @THISisDJTK damn straight @PatMcAfeeShow is hands down the funniest athlete you can follow Wish I knew Spanish better just so I could understand the music. "I wanna get so high I'm gonna cut my fucking arm off" Coed rooms? Um duh we are not responsible for ski babies though Come on cards what is this? Seriously turn on the goddamn air conditioning. Starting to sweat the second you walk in a room is not ok To make it even better the AIs that take this shit way to serious and grade all the assignments sat down right next to me #coolbro RT @terMIKEs: If it weren't for men, this planet would be overrun with giant spiders #tosh Asian dude got pulled over on Fee and instead of turning on the side road he goes up on the sidewalk #stereotypeatitsfinest @terMIKEs lmao. I just laugh when I pass those people walking up hills No classes in the morning blows when it means being in class from 1-6pm with no break "What's the scientific phrase, oh yeah I know more you don't know shit" The lecture hall chairs aren't bad but they don't get the job done cracking my back @Chief_Burton where the hell you goin? @Darianallen12 @twiterlesoliver saw him in the lounge yesterday but he looked very walking dead like Here to sign the sheet and go to sleep If professors gave the study guides out at the beginning of the semester I would never go to class #pointless RT @Iphone5offers: WE ARE NOT JOKING, WE ARE REALLY GIVING AWAY iPHONE 5's TO EVERYONE THAT FOLLOWS @omgcomedy ! (RETWEET When Done) htt ... Tests where the grades are completely ambiguous #thatshitidontlike Steady grinding on my study swag First time going to psych in over a week. There's even less people here than before I stopped coming to class @Tripinupstairs yeah I don't know why I went back tonight. Especially since it is a 7:15 class and I can get all the stuff out of the book Psych teacher uses ventriloquist for an example of illusion but doesn't show Jeff Dunham #cmonman Just found out my RA is going to be gone for the weekend. Then I remembered we have a cop that lives on the floor... "Hey Latrell you wanna play basketball today?" "Nah man I'm going to Breckinridge" #tosh $570 for a week of parties and skiing in Colorado. What do you think twitter world worth it? Mitch Daniels on the Colbert Report. My man Mitch till he pulled out the Purdue hat #fuckpurdue Attention People With Umbrellas: you do not own the entire sidewalk. #move Just thought the microwave timer was the time... Twice One other person on the whole sidewalk so you stare each other down for the whole 100 yards I hate Sundays. I want to be lazy and do nothing but I can't forget how much the next five days are gonna suck @chessscooo I got you man Gotta be impossible for anything to be more tangled than headphones that have gone through the washer Freezing cold outside 100 degrees in this lecture hall ???????????? Why you being such a bitch iMessage? About to fall asleep wake up to watch Tosh and then pass back out If google translate was accurate learning Spanish would be too easy Mind on my money money on my mind... and how I don't have any Chose to play basketball instead of writing my paper. Ankle and hammy fairly sore now #karma Someone entertain me so I don't kill myself attempting to write this paper I miss the days when I could write an entire research paper using Wikipedia and get away with it Someone invent wireless headphones with a tiny earbud that no one notices so I can put them on and space out in class Anyone else go all Sherlock Holmes and try and read the people sitting around you on the bus? Talking to the cop on our floor and I'm clearly tipsy hahahha I hate the late night walk where all there is to do is reflect on the stupid decisions made earlier in the night I may have gotten 8 hours of sleep combining the last two nights #doesthatcount Hate when I spend 10 mins workin on something like my car or computer &amp; cant fix it but my dad does the same thing I did and gets it 1st try When did my phone go to 2% battery? Seriously? When in college always drink water before going to bed. Even if it makes you have to pee it's well worth it "It's the tailgate bitches wake up" -mcslutt Added at least ten contacts to my phone last night. I know who maybe 5 of them are Just remembered time switched back today. Makes a lot more since now how I was walking back at 1:30 and made it to my room at 1:07 RT @Vargasm6: Couch + yoohoo + football = Luke doesn't do shit all day RT @Darianallen12: Can't wait until the end of November. My neck beard will be Andrew luck esque Looking at how much higher the construction fences are than normal fences and thinking back to Friday I'm glad I have no broken bones @chelsey_skeen I have no idea I just remember being in a closed in construction zone and had to hop the fence to get out @chelsey_skeen yup. Never spoke that much Spanish before in my entire life. Anyone remember high school when there was such thing as a sleep schedule and it was possible to fall asleep before 2 am @Big_Nate12 I feel ya. Five times ever once I jumped out and two of the other times was flying in a float plane Is it true Romney is actually losing in Massachusetts? #thatsgottaburn @Chief_Burton yeah I know that's why I framed it as a question. But he's projected to lose MA so what does that say? @Chief_Burton wasn't trying to get in a political debate. Not like our vote matters anyway we don't live in Ohio RT @ThatWhiteJew: I understand if you voted for Romney but if you voted for mourdock you sir are a fucking idiot So who's happy who is sad about the election results? I don't think I've heard it enough yet My no shave November patchy neck beard was driving me crazy so I decided to shave it. Of course I cut myself #karma Sleeping &gt; tailgating @hip_hipjorge those are the greatest kind of realizations Car pulls up in Foster circle with windows down and four guys smoking a joint. Not even trying to hide it Predicted the scores for the past two IU games and I've been off by only 4 points each game The grind my gears family guy episode is on #classic @BenDMcCauley Just realized a book report I thought was due Thursday isn't due until after Thanksgiving break. Dropped the book instantly @BenDMcCauley TBS NFL has had far too many pass interference calls this year that should have been no calls. Especially offensive PIs ESPN really beating the shit out of a dead horse. Quit talking about the Lakers Swear to god this floor alone could keep Febreze in business @Chief_Burton @cigga_rell0 you need motivation to stay apart of the USA? Seriously? @Chief_Burton @cigga_rell0 symbolic? I must have missed the day we stopped calling ourselves Americans. @Chief_Burton I'm familiar with the US Constitution. Are you? You have the right to say what you want, that doesn't mean it isn't ignorant. @Chief_Burton that's the Declaration of Independence not the Constitution. Read that one too. Which of your rights has been infringed upon? Probably the only game all year that I will cheer for Duke RT @TheFakeESPN: Nothing like the start of Duke's basketball season to remind us that Dick Vitale still isn't dead yet. @chelsey_skeen I call bullshit That moment when your hot water runs out in the shower before you have even touched the soap because you were making life decisions Four emergency vehicles outside my dorm at 2:30am that's not disconcerting http://t.co/ZoYXCKjg Decided to just carry my laptop and notebook cause I didn't want to take the time to remove the beverage currently stored in my backpack Whole family has been asleep for at least two hours now but I'm still wide awake. #collegesleepschedule Coldest I have ever been in my life Dammit Butler finish it off so I can watch the Hoosiers Me: "Romo sucks" My dad "I'd be chanting no mo Romo if I was a Dallas fan" @Darianallen12 you look more like a Doug You heard the man his buttocks were on the ground I want to go to a party like the one in 21 jump street "We have you on tape" #wordsyouneverwanttohear Defending is far more entertaining than prosecuting @Vargasm6 what's up dog? @Vargasm6 nothin much school and chillin... #classic You hear a lot of weird ass conversations when you walk to class after forgetting headphones I'll admit idea is an odd word to actually pronounce but there sure as hell isn't an r at the end so stop saying it like there is Psych test at 7:15 is a real pregame killer Time for the Hoosiers to do to UNC what I just did to that psych test #rape #BeatTheHeels Just held the door for the girl behind me and I didn't even make her swipe in. Apparently that's against the rules #takemetojail RT @Future_Sh0ts: #Thatawkwardmoment when you're checking out a hot girl but her fat friend notices and goes for the interception #notyo ... 12:50 feels much later when writing a paper than when just chillin Debating whether not finding headphones is a good enough reason not to go to class? @cigga_RELL0 what's the offer? If you're not attracted to her you are gay "Woah wo woah woah woah Lois this is not my batman class" @Darianallen12 beat ya to it Don't fuck with me Why? My bad haha Reading all the tweets I just caused #lolz RT @lindsey_joo: I hate when I've already looked at all the new featured on ifunny ?????? #firstworldpains Well that was one hell of a live and learn kinda night @hip_hipjorge quality background noise that is keeping me awake to finish this paper right now Just saw a student cop shake up like he had just finished a drug deal... Andrew Luck is an entirely different QB on the road @King_Freeze_ agreed I'm fine with the 60 degree weather in Btown but would appreciate it if it could snow more in Colorado #CrestedButte Sleep, why do you have to be such an elusive bastard? #insomnia If you're tights are a size that would be too big for me please don't wear them in public @tbastin63 had to see it to believe it. Passed me on the stairs. I got a little nervous @tbastin63 if there had been a bow involved shit would've gone down Don't get me wrong 9 times outta 10 no roommate is fine by me but still that 10% when it's really boring RT @chelsey_skeen: Just one time I'd like to be able to go to bed by midnight.... Finally an episode of Duck Dynasty I haven't already seen #addicted #betterthanstudying Terrible clock management. No wonder the Lions never win close games Psych test in 6.5 hours. Time to see how much information I can memorize in that amount of time and then completely forget about by tomorrow You guys see that McNutt doesn't reopen until January 2nd 2012. Where the hell are we suppose to live second semester? #epicfail Crazy! I was crazy once The love hate relationship I have with arguing grades. I love proving you wrong but damn you for making me take the time to do so C store out of monster&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Last final of my first semester of college #throwinupaprayer S/O to @TwiterlesOliver for providing a significant amount of the fun I will be having the first week of break RT @BenDMcCauley: Only on an IU bus trip. #bottomsup @NickBrehl @THE__PROFFITT @DanJFeeney http://t.co/epFePAnN @elizaruth1 @itzsqwilliams @casual_panda Tennessee hot tub flooding flashbacks haha Crossing half the country in a bus... #arewethereyet #crestedbutte #iuskisnow Watching money ball thinking of how happy I would be to even be an underrated player and get paid 237,000 to play baseball @jonesw15 where are you at?

I thought that was just for people in Florida" #Ted @chessscooo It'd be cool if I felt tired now Pass interference without even touching the wr?

If you wished for this blizzard I hate you RT @FakeSportsCentr: Nets announce target is Phil Jackson, pubescent Wyoming kid announces target is Mila Kunis All the bears fans that do nothing but talk shit about the packers all year. What do you have to say for yourselves now? Do all Big Ten refs hate IU? #forgotaboutthat @Hannah_banaana Agreed.

It really just makes my night great! #not @japellius nap duh! @chammy_cham is currently singing They Don't Know About Us into a candle stick holder and standing on the table! It is quite funny to watch. Come on Saints! You're better than this! That's what I'm talking about boys! #saints win! @chammy_cham it's because Fish isn't there. @chammy_cham that shit cray. :) Just dance &gt;&gt;&gt; study Sometimes I really want to punch people and it takes all my strength to walk away. Next time you may not be so lucky. #beware When people don't understand &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Someone has pinned a spider and I keep touching it! #iphoneprobs I am beginning to freak out about my test tonight... @chammy_cham gracias! That shit cray! @japellius if he was to give us a quiz over this material that is what it would be. @japellius for a grade, no. It's probably going to be on the test. Roar. @japellius we went through like an entire chapter today. Needless to say I was confuzzled. I really wanted to use my pepper spray but @chammy_cham wouldn't let me. #partypooper @japellius no way. I'm still in chapter 8 or maybe it's 7! Who knows? @japellius They don't. Hahah @chammy_cham or was it for your safety? Because we all know what would have happened after the pepper spray. @japellius next semester? Here? :) Next time you talk about someone make sure they cannot hear you. #dumbass @japellius @chammy_cham humph. @japellius it's all otay!

I guess that's an ok excuse. This girl is in my seat. I have sat in the same seat everyday in this class and this girl took it. #unhappy @Charnaynay I will! This is just unacceptable! No notes. No assignment. Not on the test. Why am I here? #iubb @chammy_cham that shit cray #iubb In order to keep sane I must avoid those who make me angry. I am so tired because it took all my strength not to strangle the drunkards puking in my bathroom! Can someone explain to me why people get so drunk that they have to puke? I can't seem to understand this concept. Sometimes (well mostly on Sundays) I wish I lived in the south so I can see my @Saints play some football I am not a procrastinator. I am just extremely productive at unimportant things. I am not really sure what @chammy_cham is doing. http://t.co/9aHIrXOY @chammy_cham doesn't listen to me talk so I have decided that I will just not talk to her. Today is going to be great! Snow and basketball! Sorry @TheMobDoctorFOX but #iubb is more important. I'm always wiped out after Mondays. The week should end after Monday. I am wondering when @chammy_cham thinks she will be home so I know when I should wake up from my nap to go to the game. #nottalkingtoyou I guess @chammy_cham should let Ellen know what time she is going to be home so she know when we are leaving for the game. If @chammy_cham slams the door #allhellwillbreakloose But for reals @chammy_cham should tell Ellen when we are leaving. Out of class early. What to do? I know! Pinterest. Bored in class. What to do? I know! Pinterest. @onedirection song on @HawaiiFive0CBS I'll take it! @onedirection #WMYB twice in one episode of @HawaiiFive0CBS! This just topped off an awesome day! @chammy_cham i will punch you if it goes on too long. i'm using my serious face right now even though you can't see me. @japellius i don't know how to do that one. That is the exact one that my sapling is on right now. @japellius that's usually what happens. @japellius you and me both @japellius I would but I need to drop another one so I should at least try on this one @japellius me either. I am sitting and talking to Sammy instead of reading. @japellius same but I know I will feel like an idiot if I don't at least try to study @japellius what?! @japellius oh ok! @japellius I really don't like this sapling assignment. It tells me I'm wrong when I do it the way Aron told us. Grr. Well that didn't go too well. @japellius I think (and @chammy_cham does too) that you should come over and do Sapling Chapter 10 with me. @japellius monday. why not? @japellius grrr. I am doing it tonight because I don't want to do it over break. @japellius duh. It was my idea. @chammy_cham thank you niall. Bye bye Voight. #ChicagoFire @chammy_cham PLEASE! @AreYouThayer No! that's awesome! Spaghetti in my coffee maker? That would have made an interesting flavor. I don't like this whole "you don't get tickets to every game" thing. I want to see my #iubb boys play! I just got shocked by the wall! How does that happen? "doomsday and armageddon just had a baby and it is ugly" - wreck it ralph Cody Zeller just attempted a 3 pointer! What?! I like watching #iubb on tv sometimes more than in person because the camera goes in close on Will. Twilight premier at midnight? Try Twilight premier at 10! "Well, you know what they saw about teen suicide. Don't do it." - Vampire Diaries Vampire Diaries. Sad face. I love coming home to coffee. Oh no! No more hostess! #iubb time! Maryland and Rutgers joining the Big 10? Ummm. No ESPNU? No problem. Streaming #iubb to my tv! http://t.co/rCfcs4Kr This is the iubb team I know and love! Go Hoosiers! #iubb time! @chammy_cham you can watch it on your computer. @chammy_cham that's your problem. Haha Now I remember why I don't like watching basketball on the telly.

How will I survive? @Senorita_O_Fun not even popcorn! I got nuffin! Orgo test in 1 hour! ?????? This test needs to be over with so I can watch some #iubb! @japellius heck no! I am freaking out! You? @japellius I really wish it would just start already! @japellius same. @japellius I think I died...ummm. @japellius I can't even imagine what the final will be like. @japellius I'm sure they won't kill you. They love you. Seriously injure? Maybe. @japellius sounds about right. Haha. #iubb. Nuff said. @japellius the orgo grades are up. @japellius I got a 20 point curve! @japellius you should see how big a curve you got. @japellius I sorry @japellius yeah @Senorita_O_Fun "Oh, the night is young, now baby we could shoot a Russian unicorn" Thanks for telling me about these! @Senorita_O_Fun "you know I spit on my brother" While I really like these tweets from @Saints about the #NOvsATL game, I really wish I could watch it on TV. Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! #SCANDAL I just saw an English Jeep Cherokee! It was quite awesome! It's December so now the Christmas music can begin.

Because I actually slept and I can move without being in pain so it's going to be an awesome day! @chammy_cham uh oh! TOUCHDOWN! COLTS WIN! COLTS WIN! No one gets to complain about the temperature in this apartment. No one. It's a good thing to know that I can be awoken from a nap by a fire alarm going off that isn't even in my building. #dontletithappenagain The @TheMobDoctorFOX! I can't even...I am just so excited! Why yes that is @chammy_cham singing @onedirection into a candle stick holder. #littlethings http://t.co/01Ycc3Ny Roomie complains about the temperature of the apartment. I come home and make it cool down by 5+ degrees. Maybe I am cold hearted. Or maybe I actually try to cool off the apartment instead of complaining. I'm kinda regretting making it cooler in here. :( @japellius @chammy_cham hahahahahaha! This is too funny! This was a nice break from studying. Thanks. I saw this coming from the beginning but really only 13 episodes @TheMobDoctorFOX? @japellius Take some more pics! @japellius @chammy_cham I want the videos! @chammy_cham you are a party pooper! @japellius Dead week consists of me laying in bed and watching reruns on my computer because I am too bored to do anything else. @japellius ahhhh! It's scary! http://t.co/j4WBxD8e Finally got around to listening to @dinnerandasuit and I'm loving it! @japellius very gross. I almost cried when I saw it. @japellius that works but you should still read because it is so much fun. @japellius that sounds like a plan. or if you can't fall asleep maybe you can open the book. watch Pitch Perfect for the third time instead of doing homework? heck yes. did I have to ask? "classic pun" @Senorita_O_Fun I don't actually have a physical copy. I was watching it online. @Senorita_O_Fun otay! I text it to you! I love Simon and Demi's relationship. It's hilarious! "This isn't crack. Anyone can sell crack. All you need is a street corner and a hoodie." #Arrow I know we are not the closest of friends but I will always beat someone up if you need me to. I may like the smell of coffee but that doesn't mean I want to smell like it. I think it's a rule in life that a nap should ALWAYS precede studying. 500th TWEET! Thanks @chammy_cham for getting me on Twitter. So I thought I did well on this quiz...but it turns out I didn't. Not quite sure what happened. SO EXCITING! #SCANDAL No. No. NO! #Scandal #WhoShotFitz No Huck! Ahhhh! #why #scandal finally listening to Christmas music! Alone in my apartment. What to do? Dance party for 1? Watch a sappy movie? No. Homework. @chammy_cham that shit cray. I think my phone know I should be studying...it keeps kicking me off wifi. #stupid Study? Please. Who has time for that nonsense? Mmmm. Candy canes. "Bitch slapped by a raindrop." Who thought it was a good idea to start finals at 8am? @japellius ummmm...did you really just ask if I was excited about an orgo exam? Think about that for a minute. @kayla_smock hahahaha thanks. I think my phone know I should be studying...it keeps kicking me off wifi. #stupid @japellius it makes more sense now. Hahaha @japellius fail? No way. And it is a great motivator. Before every exam I always play a 1D playlist. @japellius that's a good goal. I am confident that you will get there and with a curve possibly more! @japellius I know right! I am counting on a good curve for me to do well. #caffeineonlyhelpsaweebit @japellius Hahahaha sounds perfect. #letsdoit @japellius we should start it right now. @japellius I'm on it. #wheretofindthedrugs @japellius it's true. If I just go downtown I'll prolly find some. @japellius now. @japellius that was fucking hard. I am pretty sure I failed. Bout to change up my schedule to retake orgo I. Great. Just great. @japellius hopefully. Reevaluating my major. Happy Wat-Shot Day to all! @TheJimmyCarp any chance the mob doctor could ever be renewed for a second season? @chammy_cham did you get one for me? @chammy_cham I don't have a way to ask Payne but that's ok I'll survive without one. @japellius @chammy_cham of course! Time to start studying for my last final. #doihaveto SO EXCITED. I. CAN'T. EVEN. AHHH @chammy_cham that is not studying. “@GoogleFacts: 12.12.12 is the last repetitive date any of us will ever see.” Except me because I am going to live forever. DONE!!! WORDS CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW EXCITED I AM RIGHT NOW. BUT I HOPE THE ALL CAPS CAN. @japellius I gots a tumblr! @japellius CauseImAfraidIveLostItAll @japellius @chammy_cham yay! Home. #yay Didn't study at all for this test but got an A. Ummm. Needless to say I rock! Yummy http://t.co/Q2gHjb8E How could someone do this? I can't even imagine what these families are experiencing. It just breaks my heart. People don't understand that #guncontrolnow isn't the answer, these crazies will find another way to complete their objectives @Senorita_O_Fun @AreYouThayer I don't think I am doing anything @Senorita_O_Fun @AreYouThayer who wouldn't want to see my face. hahaha. For breakfast I had a doughnut and some candy and for lunch I had some candy and for a snack I had some candy, what a I to eat for dinner? Game Day! #iubb "And Smith has been Dairy Queened." Thank you Clark Kellogg for that. Yogi. Yogi. Yogi. I. CAN'T. HANDLE. ALL. THE. STRESS. #iubb "I haven't read the books." - me "Well they are in British" - @Senorita_O_Fun So I get a call from boss today asking me if I want to work. Of course I say yes. Then he mentions the time I have to work... 7 am! North Carolina or Texas for spring break? I can't decide. DEREK!!!! #iubb Finally got new headphones so now I can listen to music at work! #success "I just love honey mustard, it's sweet and tangy at the same time!" - @Senorita_O_Fun Happy birthday to the bestest buddy ever @Senorita_O_Fun Just conference called my family while we were sitting at the same table "we may have a White Christmas, it's just going to come at midnight." - my mum @Louis_Tomlinson Happy birthday Lou! T - 30 minutes until the 24 hours of A Christmas Story marathon begins! I only brought 5 cookies to work with me today and they are already gone...this is going to be a rough afternoon. #needmorecookies I have only been at work for an hour but I am bored out of my mind. #scanningisboring My boss always seems to pick the days with IU basketball games to send me into the field. This wouldn't be a problem except I always end up sleeping through at least part of the game. #workishard After working outside all day I am finally inside and almost warm. I missed @TheMobDoctorFOX tonight because my dog decided to attack my hand. At least I won't sleep through the #iubb game tonight because I will still be working. #workingoutsidesucks @chammy_cham we'll see Winter is here. http://t.co/AckPNyDB If tonight's episode of @TheMobDoctorFOX was intense then Monday's will be crazy! Plus Franco comes back! #soexcited I really really don't want to get out of this bed. #firstdayofclass @chammy_cham turn up the heat. @chammy_cham truth. You can wait until 1 and I'll turn it up. But that means no classes. @chammy_cham then you should just lay in bed all day. @chammy_cham you can always lay in bed dressed. @chammy_cham truth. Fact: If you took all the veins out of your body and laid them end to end, you would die. I love it when Carolyn talks to the basketball players on tv! #youtell'em I don't know if I'm going to like this "your classes don't start until afternoon" thing! #imreadyforanap @chammy_cham lets do it! I woke up 2 hours ago and I am bored out of my mind already! I'm no creeper. I am just an unpaid private investigator working on my P.I. skills. @chammy_cham hey now! What's that supposed to mean? Just saw that @dinnerandasuit is coming to Btown in Feb...I think they should come back 6 months after that when I can actually go to a bar. @dinnerandasuit looks like you will just have to come back. It's really the only possible resolution to this situation. @dinnerandasuit Bloomington, IN @chammy_cham YES! @chammy_cham do they not speak English? @chammy_cham plus you have me to answer questions @chammy_cham soon :-) #PitchPerfect with the roomie. I really want to have a John Hughes movie marathon! It's that point in the night where I am giving up on doing homework... well more like where I would stop if I had actually started. @Charnaynay @chammy_cham oh thanks you two. “@ZodiacFacts: A #Leo will always treat you like royalty until you give them a reason not to.” Yeah @chammy_cham look at that! Happy Birthday to @drewbrees and his little boy Baylen! @Saints Whatever. Just whatever. Just went out of my box and asked someone to do something for me. #collegedoescrazythingstopeople “@FUN: More than 3 million people are stalked every year.” And less than 10% of the stalkers a are women. #CriminalMinds Professor calls on me right as class is ending and I don't finish my translation so now I have to do it next time. ???????????? This minute needs to go quickly! That quiz was too easy...I must have done something wrong. FREE HUGS AT SAMPLE GATES! #onlyatIU I just don't understand why people don't wake up at the crack of dawn like I do. I am so bored right now that I am considering doing homework...help! @chammy_cham and I have figured it out! Indiana and Hoosier are Goldens and then we are getting Red and Silver Labs as the sheeladipo pair! "I look beautiful, dammit!" - @chammy_cham walking around with chocolate frosting as lipstick. The elephants upstairs really annoying. #shutup There is nothing on tv so I thought about doing homework but then I decided to get on Pinterest. #problemsolved Amish drag races? Yes, they do exist! @chammy_cham no bus?! @chammy_cham ahhh. so I should leave earlier than I normally do? @chammy_cham wow! That's nuts. @kayla_smock you're not supposed to have candles in your room. I just don't understand how some people have made it into college. #duh My AI asked me what I did on my day off and being me, I answer "nap." He probs thinks I'm a lazy bum. This wifi sucks! I have to sit next to my door to even get a signal. #grr GAME DAY! #iubb Story Time! Yes. #no #boring #naptime That right there was a sheeladipo moment! #iubb My tweets don't always involve you but they do involve @chammy_cham. I do have other interests. @chammy_cham toats! I keep waking up before my alarm... ?????? I think I may have seen this #CriminalMinds episode too many times...I'm quoting it. @chammy_cham I GOT MY BOOK! I FINALLY GOT MY BOOK! @chammy_cham were you sleeping? I wasn't sure so I said you were. @chammy_cham that's what I thought. One of the knew that so that person should have told him to shut his trap. My morning ritual: check twitter, personal email, school email, facebook, the weather, and then pinterest. 15 minutes after my alarm: in bed Because @chammy_cham keeps telling me that I am a mean person, this weekend I am going to try to be nice to everyone (with one exception). I love snow!!! @chammy_cham you are oh so negative. But I appreciate the challenge. @chammy_cham right now it's the same. @Senorita_O_Fun @chammy_cham oh señorita you have no faith in my abilities. :) Derek performed a 23 hour surgery, Meredith flew on a plane, and Karev stabbed Arizona in the foot. Just a typical #greysanatomy episode. @chammy_cham no problemo Sammy! It's a Friday afternoon and I am going back to campus...anybody else see something wrong with this? That awkward moment when the only other person on the bus is the driver. ?????? @chammy_cham with her cup o fun on this fine Saturday night. http://t.co/5UsRZhfb It's so weird not seeing Tom Crean in a suit. #iubb People really need to stop reading the books I have on hold because I really want to read them...now. Watch out world! I was nice all weekend so the meanness built up inside me and is about to explode. ?????? "Our money went to very good things: pizza and alcohol." - @chammy_cham No...we aren't watching #pitchperfect again. @chammy_cham I just love starting my days with bomb threats on buses. #walkingtocampus @chammy_cham hey now! @chammy_cham you can leave now and come and sit with me. I get to submit my study abroad application TOMORROW! I am so excited! @chammy_cham haha. You may want to go soonish though. @chammy_cham now you know how I feel when it's on. Almost got hit by a car! #notmyfault @chammy_cham YES! "Today's new friend is tomorrow's family." #NCIS #Abby someday I will invent a robot that does your homework for you and I will make millions off of it. #someday I think if this tornado thing was serious my roomies would have woke me up...maybe. Super Dome? Not anymore. Its now calls the "Supa Dome!" @Saints Gameday! #iubb @amellywood but what about #iubb! That there was a Sheeladipo moment! #iubb Waking up to snow makes me so happy! I'm in such a great mood and I don't think anything could ruin it! “@GoogleFacts: "Hypopituitarism" is a rare disease that doesn't allow a person to feel love.” Ummmm @chammy_cham probs thinks I have this. Religiously checking my email for more news on this house. WE GOT IT! WE GOT IT! #house It's so hard to stay calm in class when I know we got this house. @chammy_cham you're welcome. @chammy_cham I did. I'm so excited I'm shaking. @chammy_cham I'm trying to keep myself together in this class and freak out when I get home. I should really start reading before I come to class. #lost Nothing like an orgo quiz to ruin my excitement. Contrary to popular belief I hardly ever get mad. @chammy_cham are you here? @chammy_cham no no no! @feliciapatel we are on our way. We are going to stop at the c-store first though.

It's a finals week miracle! Michael Bublé, you're welcome in my home whenever you want. Watching Rent makes me feel better that at 19 I am not an AIDs ridden, coke addicted stripper. I'm in public laughing out loud because of this. I love you reddit. http://t.co/IfZwM2wa RT @SingleWithCats: Why choose men when you can choose Cats? RT @IUPains: If it was gonna happen I'm glad it was Butler. Finished a book and a season of doctor who today and now my soul feels empty. Five minutes into being the present wrapping assistant and I've already ripped the paper on a gift. I think I'm fired. Dad, Max, and I are embarking on an adventure called "Max's first time driving through a car wash." I'll report back later. Ohmygod it's snooooooowing @taylorbrowning http://t.co/DzHyR6xB Live tweeting Max's first doctor who experience. "Is Neil Patrick Harris the Doctor... I don't know why I thought that." "Mom buys things like fig butter and no one ever eats it. We have four packages of couscous in the pantry" #shitmaxsays This is the calm before the storm. Relatives on the way. All cleaning done. Cookies baked. Too soon to cook actual food. I'm taking a nap. Step ladders really freak me out. There shouldn't be more than one step on a step ladder. #dedecoratinggrumpiness RT @VeryGrumpyCat: No Boyfriend November &amp; Don't Date December were successful, now for Just Me January, Forever Alone February, &am ... @parksandrecnbc gives me so much Indiana pride. It should be a required viewing at all schools. New Year's Day mimosas! Just in case you are planning on being around me for the next few days or weeks or months, I may be singing Les Mis songs constantly. They have a whole section of wiener dog dishes at target right now. @KarinaCardella @danimal90 http://t.co/w0OHBIvn Why are the animal abuse commercials 10x longer than any other commercial? #whyyyyyyyyyyyyy Apparently my first day of work was supposed to be yesterday and not today. Who knew? (answer: not me) #loooooooooongsemester Dropped my ID somewhere on the way to practice. Found it on the walk home. #yes #bestthingever This classroom smells like a damp dirty towel. Looking up yoga videos on YouTube because @KarinaCardella is at the library. I like her DVD better. #comehome If you drink water out of a mason jar I automatically assume it's moonshine. #crazyhipsters Thought I was almost done with my homework when I realized the video I have to watch for painting is 20 minutes of someone painting. #what There's very few things more disappointing than peeling your pre-class clementine and realizing it's rotten. #awman “@pwindell: Two 2k's at practice this morning so ya know it's gonna be a good day.” Naps on naps on naps. Chocolate muffin is a grown up word for giant fluffy brownie that's shaped like a muffin. I have no problem with this. I just changed my school email page to a cupcake theme. I think that's a good indication of how the rest of the day will go. #swimmingly Chicken nuggets and Mac and cheese for lunch. #heyimfive "Holy shit there are fucking Doritos??" -anonymous @T_Himes I wasn't being totally selfless. I really wanted a Hoosier Scramble. #recoverybreakfast "Are you guys going to an 80s party?" Ummm this was supposed to be an 80s party. Awkward party adventures with @KarinaCardella My meals this week have included, mac n cheese, chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, tomato soup, and lunchables. #yup #imachild If everyone in class falls asleep during the movie you show, maybe you shouldn't show that movie. #justathought On a scale from 1 to "absolutely thrilled about going back to the art building", I'd say I'm at a "would much rather go home and sleep". I'm in this big ass coat. Not from a thrift shop, but I bet it's stuck in your head now. I survived my first show at the box office. Passin out will call tickets like a boss. #thuglife I was so confused when I went outside and there was snow. Normally there's a slew of posts on social media about a change in weather. I guess when you have an 8 am class you get to experience the weather first hand. Just found out I've seen three of my coworkers naked... Context: they were in a production of Hair. Looking for a pen during English class and I pull scissors and an exacto knife out of the bottom of my purse. #artschoolprobs RT @CampKesemIU: If you aren't at Rachael's Cafe right now then you're missing out! Get out here! The only reason I'm sad I don't live in Collins anymore is that I don't regularly encounter tall hipster fiddle players. I just signed an online petition because cartoon network cancelled my favorite cartoon. This is what my life has come to. @LizziPomeroy Avatar is a lifestyle, not a cartoon (it's also on Nick). CN cancelled Young Justice. Which is wonderful and will be missed. That concludes my geeky tweeting for the evening. I bid ye all goodnight. Oh hey, winter. Did you enjoy your vacation? Sometimes I forget I have a tattoo and catching a glimpse is like a pleasant little surprise. #oneyear #moreplease I underestimated the number of people that would be at noodles. Now I feel uncomfortable for coming here by myself. #notstoodup #justhungry Fan girling over Eddie Redmayne with @KarinaCardella @lgardiner10 @kbruecks @hbrueck. Sounds like the perfect Friday to me.

Along with prescription meds and so onnn. when do we all stop caring again? #reallythough spending a little time on Facebook tonight almost made me miss it.. then I was like LOL no. what would happen if we just divied up the national debt between every living american, slowly paid it off, and then stfu about it? @lugnut2012 16 trillion divided by 7 billion is about $2,285 each. $20 a month would put a huge dent in that over time. I did say slowly btw @lugnut2012 okay, miscalculation but 314 billion live in America lol. This is just food for thought, not like it will actually happen. @lugnut2012 314 million** damn lol @lugnut2012 maybe we should just take half of all pro athletes paychecks and pay it off. I bet that'd go much faster. is there a job that pays you to Google random shit all day? I wanna do that. so Facebook told me that some pages I may like are Hot Pockets, Kush, and The Sandlot lol.

Not getting it again. :| Collected the mail. No letter yet. Anxious for it to come. Coffee shop girls, I did not come here to listen to your opinions on abortion. Sometimes I wish it was possible to give things anti-kudos so that the author knew you thought they didn't do a good job. GOT AN INTERVIEW WITH BARNES AND NOBLE. !!! Forgot to put on earrings to hide the scar on my earlobe. Damn it. (I know nobody cares about my earlobe scar, but I feel better when it's covered. And i'm going to be overanalyzing my appearance anyway.) Officially a gtraduate student! I'm so happy. o/ I should also mention that I think my Barnes &amp; Noble interview went GR8. Fingers crossed that they liked me--I'd love to work there. :D @tanyart THANK YOU SO MUCH so excited. &lt;3 Fun fact: I /still/ haven't received my letter of acceptance to school, but I got a notice that I can start signing up for classes on 11/13. It noted that I would need my school ID, which was in the letter of acceptance, so I was like, oh shit. But I decided to try my undergrad ID number just in case they decided to give me the same one. LO AND BE-FUCKING-HOLD. Moral of the story: If you go to your alma mater for grad school, they keep it warm for you. It's pretty sweet. @bodicegoddess I live across the street from St. Kate's as of the beginning of the month, actually. o/ @bodicegoddess Oh, fun! I went there last night to celebrate. Sitting next to a table of old Jewish men arguing over whether we have all of Cervantes' and Shakespeare's manuscripts. Now they're arguing about whether Elizabeth Taylor was Jewish or just converted (and did you know Sammy Davis was Jewish). This is basically the best morning ever. I got a job! I GOT A JOB AT BARNES AND NOBLE! &lt;3 @tanyart I think I can claim the blame there. @tanyart I think that's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. ;^; @tanyart I once read the autobiography of the woman who played Dr. Quinn. I'm still not sure why, because I've never watched that show. @tanyart This is my full contribution to the conversation at hand. "You don't need to feel sorry for Mitt Romney, he's doing fine. Just do your homework." - the dad behind me What if we just sat around and listened to Elliott Smith all day? What about that, Mr. Sun? Finished my first day of working retail! I might be jinxing myself by saying it's really fun, but I really, genuinely enjoyed myself. :D (I used to get so lonesome at my old job. Seeing all kinds of people today was such a lovely change. I get to ask them how they're doing!) @plasticities Thank you! I am, too. I was kind of nervous, but I feel like I made the right choice here. I am going to write a story that is so tooth-rottingly sweet that everyone in a ten-mile radius gets diabetes. NO. NOBODY WANTS A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO MAKE YOUR SHITTY ONE DIRECTION GRAPHIC. IF YOU HAVE TO ASK, THE ANSWER IS NO. WHYYYYYYYYY http://t.co/CM0sRcE7 that is just the scariest picture of alan cumming that I have seen in my life. God, I am so tempted to get myself another baked good. Whoever coined the word "impactful" needs to be repeatedly flogged. If you think that the Divergent series is even approaching decent, let alone "really good," you are an idiot. Those books are mindblowingly terrible. I wish I'd brought my headphones so I wouldn't have to listen to this babble. Supposed to sell 5 holiday books this shift.sold 6 before my 1st break! Old man bought a gay softcore skin mag. I was so flustered by the boys in their briefs on the cover. BATS: Officially renamed "flappy paws." Seriously, can't we just have socialized medicine? That would make my life so much easier. OH HEY I KNOW THAT CAR: http://t.co/Ik08xuak MICHAEL J. FOX IS IN THIS EPISODE THIS SHOW IS THE VERY GREATEST ONE HOOKER I would like to politely put forth that everyone is enjoying Little Women incorrectly. #stopmakingscreencapsonlyofchristianbale ...Seriously, I am tired of looking at Jo and Laurie's faces. Where are my damn screencaps of Beth? #maybeiamdoingthiswrong how is it that I am already ready for bed? I could sleep right now, and I don't know why. I lose respect for you if you make general graphics about a movie starring a female character and only include male characters. :| heartbroken that googling "anderson cooper trill" doesn't result in pictures of anderson cooper with leopard spots. Why do you start getting Sherlock results when you look up Inspector Lewis? Is it because God hates me? And then I spent five minutes explaining to @pitselly why I think catfish are scary. I am 25 years old, ladies and gentlemen. ...oh, that's not @landruu's name anymore. GDI. Downed 16oz of black tea in one go! Ready to work. One longs to bring friends from faraway to the mall so we can all hang out and eat crepes. Important question of the afternoon: Should I download brushes of Vulcan script? Oh, gosh, they put my timecard up on the break room bulletin board because I did a good job selling holiday books #flattered #andembarrassed I'm glad I get pictures of white people when I try to look up pictures of this black guy. That is really helpful to my search. These graphics are impossible. I give. I have never in my life ordered a 24oz drink from starbucks. I am just so tired this morning. And I just drank all of it. Jesus christ. It's strange and a little unsettling to find tiberius' cat hair places I've previously been at work. I do not have any idea why every story is not about the Dolorosa. I feel like that is what would improve most of these, is more Dolorosa. "A humanstuck interpretation of The Signless's life." I'm pretty sure that we already have that, actually, and it's called the Bible. @tanyart ahahaha, this brings back memories of learning how EHR software works. EXCEPT THERE WAS ACTUAL STOOL IN YOUR STORY you poor thing. @tanyart yeah, I got so nauseous learning I&amp;O charting. I am so impressed by your actually doing it, man. @tanyart you could have a hardboiled egg eating contest like in cool hand luke. @tanyart they also do it in cowboy bebop, if that helps. (don't do it, nobody actually wins in a hard-boiled-egg-eating contest.) It's so lovely and pleasant to make things for others. Suddenly wondering why I don't have ice cream, because this is my life. Gosh, David Cassidy was really dreamy. Man could not give fewer bothers what I wrapped kavalier &amp; clay in for him. Gave him the hanukkah paper. #themes! Please don't ship human/pokemon. :( @pericardium THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF FANDOM. but yeah, why would you I just can't. Customer declared our Hanukkah wrapping paper the Christmasiest option. Did not argue with her. Could I PLEASE have a story that doesn't include any Garak/Bashir, for the love of God. You guys @landruuu won't let me read this epic poem about Jadzia and Worf's relationship aloud it's not faiiiiiir. (IT RHYMES. and the author proudly proclaims that she sent it to Terry Farrell, who loved it.) "Worf awoke and sat straight up in bed. This was a pretty odd dream, especially for a Klingon, to have." I feel like i'm goingto vomit. My manager is now talking about how hot he thinks the supernatural boys. @tanyart BECAUSE YOU HATE AMERICA @tanyart oh, I hate bell peppers, too. I think that whoever gave them to you hates america. I regret not having any hot drinks in the house, my throat is all scratchy. ._. maybe if I hid out on the ground floor of my apartment building, I could get the cafe's wireless without going outside in the snow. am I the only one who sees the program name "calibre" and pronounces it "cuh-libra"? SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS A BIOGRAPHY OF V.C. ANDREWS. BUT HOW DO I PURCHASE IT. (did you know that v.c. andrews is one of my main vices. some people drink to the point of blackout, I read gothic incest melodramas.) THIS COPY OF CARRIE IS ALL IN SPANISH. ARGHFHSFGHDLFHSJDKF. Hungry and uninterested in eating chicken for breakfast. Tempted to go out for a sprinkle donut. (In my defense, I am sick and pathetic and could certainly use the hot drink I would also get.) Why are ginger chai lattes allowed to be this delicious? It tastes like honey and the dreams of children on my throat. #fuck Smearing vaseline all over my sad chapped nose. #excitingnightsathome #toomanysniffles Cod damn. I mean it. Cod. Damn. I am a mouthbreather for the foreseeable future because breathing through my nose hurts. Look up Singin' in the Rain screencaps &gt; Get Star Trek screencaps #confused I'm glad that now everyone is going to think I'm a weirdo thanks to @landruuu, rather than someone who just happens to find terrible things. A day is always successful when you make a brendan fraser friend. This yogurt is far too sweet. #worstproblems ASPECT RATIOS. they are your FRIENDS. please stop fighting them. I love when tumblr tells me that I'm a bad person for failing to sign a petition I didn't know about. We bought a bag of Marshmallow Mateys, and every time we pour some out, the cats assume it's food for them. (Marshmallow Mateys are off-brand Lucky Charms in which every cereal piece is shaped like an anchor. In case you didn't know.) This is not a very good chai latte. Damn it, least talented barista. I think she made me a normal tea. God, normal tea is fucking terrible. Why did I get this terrible drink, it was the worst choice. If you google "good inspirational fiction," you get "popular inspirational fiction." This is what is wrong with Christianity. ...What happened is Christmas over now oh my god internet I just want to adjust my car payment PLEASE LET ME. AREA MAN CONSIDERS HIMSELF SUPERIOR TO HARRY POTTER. NEWS AT ELEVEN. I feel like I'm gonna vom. also, did you know that I'm actually amazing at making bread? GUYS I CAN MAKE CIABATTA LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. when I have no money left, I will survive on ciabatta bread. I will give it to people for Christmas in place of presents. Man demanded to donate "whatever that thing with the kittens is" to children in need. I think he'd been drinking. (That said, it was quite generous of him to donate a kitten puzzle! I just loved how he asked to.) Well, I guess the person who was writing for me defaulted after all, considering that the deadline's past. Ouch. #yuletide @tanyart you are good daughters. SUDDENLY IT'S WARM IN HERE OH THIS IS NICE. and now it's cold again boo. @landruuu and to top it all off, now they have to play this fucking avett brothers song. I LOVE IT BUT WHY S IT SO SAD ugh, tempted to buy a scotcharoo. All my bitterness that there are 3 Dead Poet's Society fics and 0 School Ties fics so far. (AND WHERE IS ALL MY LAWLESS UGH.) Uguhghughguhfsughguhguisfhgf the girls next to us are SO. LOUD. Stop being social, I want to write. :| I think I'm too tired to write that last story, which makes me sad. Maybe I'll find another one to write instead. my feet hurt why isn't it 6:30 yet JFC, I'm getting 4 stories for Yuletide. o.o Hurry up, reveals. OH MY GOD IT'S A BONE KEY/MUMMY CROSSOVER. SOMEBODY UP THERE LOVES ME I was going to read my stories tonight, but I am Just Too Tired. Just knowing what they are makes me happy enough. We are looking at Boo's new cockapoo calendar so that we don't have to look at the ASPCA ad about sad abused animals. LOOK IT'S NILES. Had a dream about infiltrating the Bog. It wasn 't strictly a nightmare, except all dreams about the Borg are because the Borg. So now I'm exhausted-awake, ugh. I want to go back to sleep, but that was actually the second nightmarei had tnight Let's take a minute or two to appreciate how great Colin Sweeney is. I love that slimy bastard so much. (Also, I'm going to be watching all the good wife, because omg this fucking show. IT'S LIKE HAVING FRIENDS.) And I appreciate that Alicia is stuck being a shitty person in this episode. I love this show so mah-uch. ;-; ALICIA AND KALINDA STILL AREN'T FRANDS THE SHOW TRICKED ME :&lt; Oh god, diane, how did you get into a love triangle. Oh, are we back to kalindasodes? YESSSSSSSSS Oh god baby grace. Alicia was a good mom D: LOOK LANA IS BACK. Oh my god this episode is the culmination of all my hopes and dreams. GOD DAMN IT, PETER. Jackie has a fabulous gay hairdresser I just can't FINISHED EYE IN THE DOOR OMG I'm eating horrifically unhealthily today and I just don't give a shit. It is so one of those days. It's only occurred to me now that I haven't eaten a single proper meal today Oh, god, kalinda. YOUR SAD WANTS-TO-PROTECT-ALICIA FACE. Kalinda stop breaking my heart this was supposed to end in hugs Cafe was closing as I came, which puts paid to that idea. Nothing to do nowhere to go and no way to check my damn email. There should be a place where friendless losers without internet can spend new years' eve that isn't a bar. I really didn't want to spend new year's all alone with my cats. I can't even watch tv because we don't have cable/an antenna. Verily, I am the most pathetic loseer tonight, considerring that I don't even receive twitter updates on my phone anymore. Apparently the barista I hate just found out that cat scratch fever is a real thing. I'm glad she's telling us all about it. Getting a sandwich from the cafe because fuck it, I didn't do anything fun yesterday. @tanyart HAPPY NEW YEAR, TANYA. ...what ABOUT Ronald Ree-gin, noisy old lady? this oatmeal is terrible, but I am going to eat it anyway. I paid for it, and I need to eat SOMETHING. :| NOBODY WANTS TO LOOK AT SCREENCAPS OF YOUR SIMS CHARACTER HAVING SEX STOP TAGGING IT WITH THE NAME OF THIS CHARACTER I LIKE. #tumblr #geez That soup tasted like starlight and dream powder, but now I feel like I'm going to throw up. #whatdo @tanyart but tanya, it's het. how else would you know it was het if it didn't include virgin airheads and creepers DX GOD DAMN IT, GOODREADS, I DON'T WANT TO READ THE GODDAMN PARASOL PROTECTORATE. oh thank god @tiberrrrius has decided I can get up and do things other than support his head while he flops around and purrs.

It will have to grow on me, i'm a little iffy about it.

I do miss you @Blazingg_Asian don't let it go to your head. I only miss you a little bit. That awkward and annoying moment when rhianna IGs her ass. #tmi #saveitforchris Why do I follow her anyway? @LoafieSchulz lol, sophie the world is not going to end This performance just further confirmed my opinion of 1D. #theysuck @LoafieSchulz ??? @LoafieSchulz wow. But they're not saying today is rapture day, they're saying the world is going to end permanently. That means no rapture. Just bought my @justinbieber tickets My deaf dog is barking at the snow. Finally got a christmas tree! #fraserfir @racobjoberts your stripper should be there within the hour. I wanted you to experience him before the world ends. ;-) @hunterdowler did you get your justin bieber ticket yet? Purdue in french means "to lose" @hunterdowler aww I'm sorry. It was really hard. I will bring you a souvenir @hunterdowler 75 but it was one of my christmas gifts @hunterdowler no but you can get them from http://t.co/RwGO7Mxs Wrapping christmas presents and being ocd &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; #everythinghastobeperfect Fuck the Bengals! #steelernation #MadAsHell Finally finished wrapping gifts. 198 days to the @justinbieber concert! #I'mABelieber Good men are so hard to find.... Even though the Kentucky game wasn't against IU, I am still extremely happy that they lost. Can't wait to see Justin Bieber in july Listening to Taylor Swift during a hard breakup &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; #WhatWasIThinking @racobjoberts I miss you!!! I hate being ignored.... Andy Reid got fired... Yes yes yes!!! #ecstatic #AboutTime Drinking with my parents... Kim and Kanye are having a baby. *spits out dr. pepper* SHE'S NOT EVEN DIVORCED YET!!!!! #LordHelpThatBaby Pretty sure this revelation just crashed google though. #annoyed A new epipen is $300. #thestruggle Time to panic... Taylor Swift is on one channel and Justin Bieber is on the other!!!! #problemsolve #needasolution Go party or stay home??? Idk my bed feels awesome right now... Watching the I Heart Radio music fest. What the hell is Prince wearing???? Some of Lady Gaga's outfits look better. #crazy #HasHeLostHisMind I have officially watched the new twilight three times and yes, I have cried all three times. 17 credit hours, a job, student organization meetings, learning groups, &amp; J-board chairperson duties... #thissemester #fml #killmenow Always see popups saying "sexy girl wants to chat" or a pic of a girl w/ huge boobs. Just once can I get a guy w/ nice abs or a huge penis?? That annoying moment when you start the washer but forget to turn on the dryer... #Theannoyingmomentwhen you can't eat or drink after 12, you do until 11:59 then clock strikes 12 and your mouth is drier than Sahara Desert That moment when the lab technician tells you you didn't have to fast for your lab test &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

They aren't flashy about it, but the unique ways they dress and the way they talk says it all. Girl, when you talk, it looks like you're trying to do so without moving your lips. No one said emotion was a bad thing. #talkingcorpse So soooooore Looking back, this weekend was pretty freakin cray.

God? Is that you? Decisions, decisions. I need a sign. RT @NikkiB_3: I guess I should probably start studying Stop playin. Remember when @HilarySmith_93 cried during Cast Away senior year? What a Sally. Hope @joancmax is ready for me to move in when I get back ;) When you feel the need to advertise the single life, that screams loneliness to me. @joancmax I love you Jonas brother. But seriously. When am I gonna see you :( This bus driver is too funny right now. It's the little things. Came a little too close to forgetting who I am. No worries, I remember now. Not gonna go down that road. #peacefultweet @HilarySmith_93 I think you should actually be apologizing for replying to my tweet like 4 days late Good job me :) @j3nn_girl yes :) Only one final at five today.

Jesus just say what you want to say stop speaking in code and trying to mess with me. @natejonesiu haha yeah thanks Nate I've been waiting for that all day Miss my roomie already :'( @twitterlesskatie @Taylormariah28 love you too babe miss you so so much :) Why do the announcers talk as if they've played the game for years? "You want topspin on the ball when you hit." Yes, clearly. Texas has got it. @joancmax how do you just read my mind like that :) @joancmax through thick and thin babe I love you so so much. Only hours before I see my sister :) S/o to @bouncingfemi! Happy birthday champ!!! "I need a quarter pounder!" "Mariah?" "Morgan!!!" Haha lady is crazzzzyyyy @morgan_leach Officially in Illinois!!!!! Sinus headache from hell. Starting my morning off with some 21 Jump Street. Really missing my team right now hahahah #angryblackcaptian CHOCOLATE CHIP WAFFLES :) I've had it with being sick. Home all alone. Really wish @joancmax would get out of school already #screwyouunity Well, I want one, but they're all mean :( Never quite realized how much I missed home. Finally got around to watching Ted. Just one more movie to quote I guess lol "It ain't what people call you, it's what you answer to." Morning television is absolutely terrible. Wish I was actually capable of sleeping in past eight. Startin' off strong "I want things not the way they are! Change it!" @twitterlessolivia Chocolate peppermint cookies hell yeah #tistheseason Need a fun change. Something different to spice things up a bit. Cannot get enough of this song Thank God I got out of the house today. #cabinfever What the ef is there to eat around this joint?! The McRib is back? I know you expect me to be excited, but if it's sooooo good then why does it keep leaving? Riddle me that. Who's ready for a surprise at work ;) Late night road trip! #thebest Most decent genuine guy I know Did I say "A duck has three eyelids" or "Adele has three islands"? Polar Express? Yes. Damn straight. Absolutely. I hate animals. Can I say that? Well, it's pretty much official now. @becmax12 whoever hacked your twitter has terrible spelling. well idk if you meant to say "defiantly", but the rest of the sentence suggests you meant "definitely". The dust on this fan right now Well this is freakin weird She always answers me like it's a silly question to ask. @j3nn_girl ahahah gag me "but I would never do that!" OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T BECAUSE IT'S JUST A GAME!!!! Bought my mommy's Christmas present today :) #soexcited Wow....yeah....you guys uh.....well....you can't sing. @joancmax @becmax12 I've been dead to the snapchat world for far too long. Time to get things back to normal around here. Four Christmases. Good 'ol time. There's no place like Joan's for the holidays. Well it's a good thing you followed me, considering I have absolutely no idea who you are. Idk why I keep trying so hard when it's not gonna work. That's not me. I feel like I don't know anything about you When "big pimpin'" comes on the radio. Yesssss #oldschool #thugflow @ameliamarie43 please tell me you did not buy anything from that store @ameliamarie43 ahahaha wtf what would you buy there I love being cold everywhere I go @collsmith11 just let him find out when you wear that bangin new outfit lol I should probably get around to eating some real food today. Really starting to miss my team. @Katie_Lannon who's that sexy fox in the middle? @Katie_Lannon mmmm I wanna get at that That's not really something you need advice on @j3nn_girl @chanteeeeeee I was just about to say that!!! That was terrifying You're singing the words to a song when you come to realize you can't stand that song. Sleeping with a stuffy nose = little slice of hell. And you can't talk to ME about this because......... Thank God for Nicki Minaj Relaxing at home is overrated. @natejonesiu I love that song! You get used to the nose bleeds. It's like pulling teeth I want Subway more than my life right now. Gangster Squad #mustsee #ryangosling #january11 Watching rush hour hahah forgot how awesome this movie is. "That's Ricky Tan? That's a midget in a bathrobe." Lmao losing it right now. Bro wtf why bother RT @SnapchatProbbz: When people open my snapchat and don't reply http://t.co/XAAUdckX Jim Gaffigan's stand up hahah love this. #yes #greatmorning So bored Well as fun as this is...... I'm sick of small town living where the flashiest attraction is the post office. No clean forks huh? Good thing I found some spare chopsticks. @j3nn_girl hahah wtf did you just say When the random guy in the doctors office suddenly decides he's gonna control the tv. What?

I just participated in the Group Identity Project! Check it out: http://t.co/dhlI4NwH+ So tired. RT @rickcourage: ???????????? Calc exam 3. ???????????? @KaycieLynn_ @xqheather22 gross!! "This is where 80 billion people ask Santa for Playstations and Ugg boots for their teenage daughters." @txylorchrist I could actually see you doing that to someone. Home sweet home. Also, I get home and Alien is on TV. It's a good day. @moretore Insomniac life. @moretore Yep. I've done that a few times while being up all night. @moretore There usually is. However, we're on Thanksgiving break right now so I'm home for the week. @moretore true. I cannot wait for that meal! Family dinner tonight. Let's go IU! not my fault, not my fault, I did not do this, the computer had suggestions and the default option was "yes". @_cagafuego Maybe that'll change like the voting age did when people made that argument. @_cagafuego shit. That's some intense shit. Made the escalator stop at circle center. Oops. @alexcoomler reason why I quit going to my math class. RT @AshOfPalletTown: #ThoughtsDuringSchool Why go to school when I can drop out and become a Pokemon Master. @alexcoomler Gross. Why? Curse you sun and your eight minute old light blinding me and almost making me get hit by a person on a bike @Houdini_Fresh your house has never been cold. Peppermint hot chocolate is the best drink ever. 11-1 way to go Falcons! @BearJordan_ I could see it happening. @moregungainkuh the joys of being an insomniac. @moregungainkuh true. You aren't just laying in bed tossing and turning. Watching Courage the Cowardly Dog instead of paying attention in class.#collegelife @coryell_kristen Prolly not. You should be paying attention and not on twitter missy. @coryell_kristen high school rebel. Original. Wish I was that cool. @coryell_kristen I'll try. good friend or no? RT @Houdini_Fresh: Cow and Chicken, hands down second best show eva made #afterboymeetsworld It's 4:44 in the morning and I'm wide awake. Fuck! My science of sex professor just started singing third eye blind to us. @BearJordan_ Yeah, and it's terrifying being in the car when it happens. @BearJordan_ Fuck that! You're probably the worst tired driver I know. @BearJordan_ yeah, you probably are. Time to spend the rest of my night listening to Kanye and studying for my Psych test. It's so late and I'm not even tired. I have not slept in so long. Shit. @lanie_toons you're obsessed with those pictures. 99.9% that leaves enough percent to avoid a lawsuit. So much studying. So little sleep. #Finalsweek Final final and it's calculus. Have to get at least a C! It's creepy hearing music playing from a room no one had been in since Wednesday @rickcourage no. I left at 8 this morning. RT @BearJordan_: That awkward moment when you flip your pillow over but there is no cool side. ?????? @BearJordan_ That's fucking hilarious! @BearJordan_ I can't think of any good ones. @BearJordan_ Yeah, it made the last 5 minutes of the movie awkward for everyone around. I'm just going to have the news on all day tomorrow to hear what all the crazy people do. I came home with the intention of fixing my sleep schedule, but I haven't gone to bed before 8 a.m. once. #insomniacproblems RT @fuckistry: If you can dream it, you can make it happen. With LSD. @moregungainkuh You're getting a hedgehog!? I'm so jealous! @moregungainkuh I don't blame you for asking for one. .lol. I would so love to have a hedgehog! @moregungainkuh They are adorable! I'll definitely come see it! I can hear my stepdad's stereo from the street. Jell-O is the first company to make a we survived the apocalypse commercial. @BearJordan_ But, my dog is the most the most annoying dog in the world. @BearJordan_ He bit me the day I came home from break. Rugrats Christmas special. Yep, good day. Best part of today is knowing that I get 5 dollars when I get back to IU. @BearJordan_ Yeah. I smacked him with a remote. @BearJordan_ He hasn't tried to fuck with me again. @TaylorAllen1D It's a book too!? My sleep schedule is so fucked. @TaylorAllen1D Never knew. I haven't seen the movie, so I know nothing about it. Which did you like more? @TaylorAllen1D That's good. I think my parents might have it, would you like to watch it together, so we both can see it? @TaylorAllen1D Haha that's perfectly fine. No need to worry! Hope you enjoy it! @Houdini_Fresh My stepdad is the fastest drunk driver. @Houdini_Fresh Dude, let's go. @Houdini_Fresh Parent's house. It's off of Madison. @moregungainkuh use your twitter handle. You're all gonna die. The only question is how you check out. Do you want it on your feet? Or on your fuckin' knees... begging? #goodmovie @moregungainkuh The one thing people want during a blizzard is seafood. @lanie_toons You're so funny, Lanie. @lanie_toons It is when you aren't a giant jerk! @lanie_toons A tad bit, not as much as you miss me though. @alexismcentire It's great down there. @alexismcentire It was good! The semester really flew by, and nothing was as bad as I thought. You'll really enjoy it. @alexismcentire Anything is better than APES. What are you going to study? Finally finished updating my new phone. @txylorchrist Haha ten years ahead Taylor. Owing negative money to college is great. No worries for the new semester. http://t.co/0aulTRfQ Does Hell have beds? You'd think they'd have bed of spikes or spider. Or spiky spiders... spikers. @moregungainkuh How did you not know? .lol. @moregungainkuh Obviously Morgan, I was joking. @_ketchasketch hot chocolate is fantastic. @coryell_kristen Really? @coryell_kristen you're a joke. @coryell_kristen I do. Honestly. @coryell_kristen That's fine by me. Fuck the cold. @_ketchasketch Teleportation, duh! Got into Chemistry after they said I probably wouldn't when I was waitlisted at 80th. Woo! Way to fucking go Falcons! Chem lab wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. I almost forgot how great wireless headphones were. #smartinvestment @Meranda_Gann text me. I don't have your number right now. @TaylorAllen1D AP English prompts are never that bad. @TaylorAllen1D Haha,I bet you can handle any English prompt thrown at you. @tempy_01 at least you're 3 hour lab isn't at 7 at night. @tempy_01 it does. Trust me I hate it. @iss_krystyna @Leeexski she's a magician.
